8 lessons on building a company people enjoy working for | The Way We Work, a TED series
Transcriber: Ivana Korom
Reviewer: Krystian Aparta
HR jargon makes me crazy.
We have to have all these stupid acronyms
that describe things that nobody
understands: OKRs and PIPs.
I think we can run our businesses
by just talking to each other
like regular human beings.
We might actually get more done.
[The Way We Work]
I really always wanted to be
an HR professional,
I wanted to be able to speak
the language of management.
And you know what I've learned
after all this time?
I don't think any of it matters.
There's all kinds of things
that we call "best practices"
that aren't best practices at all.
How do we know it's best?
We don't measure this stuff.
In fact, I've learned
that "best practices" usually means
copying what everybody else does.
Our world is changing
and evolving all the time.
Here are some lessons to help you adapt.
Lesson one: Your employees are adults.
You know, we've created so many layers
and so many processes
and so many guidelines
to keep those employees in place
that we've ended up with systems
that treat people like they're children.
And they're not.
Fully formed adults
walk in the door every single day.
They have rent payments,
they have obligations,
they're members of society,
they want to create
a difference in the world.
So if we start with the assumption
that everybody comes to work
to do an amazing job,
you'd be surprised what you get.
Lesson two: The job of management
isn't to control people,
it's to build great teams.
When managers build great teams,
here's how you know it.
They've done amazing stuff.
Customers are really happy.
Those are the metrics that really matter.
Not the metrics of:
"Do you come to work on time?"
"Did you take your vacation?"
"Did you follow the rules?"
"Did you ask for permission?"
Lesson three: People want to do work
that means something.
After they do it,
they should be free to move on.
Careers are journeys.
Nobody's going to want to do
the same thing for 60 years.
So the idea of keeping people
for the sake of keeping them
really hurts both of us.
Instead, what if we created companies
that were great places to be from?
And everyone who leaves you
becomes an ambassador
for not only your product,
but who you are and how you operate.
And when you spread that kind
of excitement throughout the world,
then we make all of our companies better.
Lesson four: Everyone in your company
should understand the business.
Now, based on the assumption
that we've got smart adults here,
the most important thing we can teach them
is how our business works.
When I look at companies
that are moving fast,
that are really innovative
and that are doing amazing things
with agility and speed,
it's because they're collaborative.
The best thing that we can do
is constantly teach each other what we do,
what matters to us, what we measure,
what goodness looks like,
so that we can all drive
towards achieving the same thing.
Lesson five: Everyone in your company
should be able to handle the truth.
You know why people say
giving feedback is so hard?
They don't practice.
Let's take the annual performance review.
What else do you do in your whole life
that you're really good at
that you only do once a year?
Here's what I found:
humans can hear anything if it's true.
So let's rethink the word "feedback,"
and think about it as telling people
the truth, the honest truth,
about what they're doing right
and what they're doing wrong,
in the moment when they're doing it.
That good thing you just did, whoo!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Go do that again.
And people will do that again,
today, three more times.
Lesson six: Your company needs
to live out its values.
I was talking to a company
not long ago, to the CEO.
He was having trouble
because the company was rocky
and things weren't getting done on time,
and he felt like things were sloppy.
This also was a man who, I observed,
never showed up to any meeting on time.
Ever.
If you're part of a leadership team,
the most important thing that you can do
to "uphold your values" is to live them.
People can't be what they can't see.
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality,"
and then we proudly pound our chest
because we'd achieved 30 percent
representation of women
on an executive team.
Well that's not equal, that's 30 percent.
Lesson seven: All start-up
ideas are stupid.
I spend a lot of time with start-ups,
and I have a lot of friends that work
in larger, more established companies.
They are always pooh-poohing
the companies that I work with.
"That is such a stupid idea."
Well, guess what:
all start-up ideas are stupid.
If they were reasonable, somebody else
would have already been doing them.
Lesson eight: Every company
needs to be excited for change.
Beware of the smoke of nostalgia.
If you find yourself saying,
"Remember the way it used to be?"
I want you to shift your thinking to say,
"Think about the way it's going to be."
If I had a dream company,
I would walk in the door and I would say,
"Everything's changed, all bets are off.
We were running
as fast as we can to the right,
and now we'll take a hard left."
And everybody would go "Yes!"
It's a pretty exciting world out there,
and it's changing all the time.
The more we embrace it
and get excited about it,
the more fun we're going to have.

Patty McCord: 4 lessons the pandemic taught us about work, life and balance | TED
Transcriber: 
I've spent the last couple of years
traveling around the world
giving talks to big corporations
and little bitty start-ups
and lots of leadership teams
and women's groups,
and what I've been talking
to people about,
I've been trying really hard
to convince people
that we can change the way we work.
But every time I do a talk,
somebody comes backstage
or follows me offstage
and says, "You know,
I'm so inspired by what you say.
It's so great, it makes so much sense.
But we can't."
"We can't because we're regulated."
"We can't because our CFO says
we can't do it."
"We can't because we're in Europe."
“We can’t because 
we’re a service industry.”
"We can't because we're a nonprofit."
And then last year came the pandemic.
And the pandemic changed everything
all over the world.
Service people started realizing
that they had to suit up and wear masks
and take temperatures
and wash their hands.
We had to start standing
six feet apart in lines.
We started working from home.
We started working virtually.
And we started learning
all kinds of things because we had to.
All that muscle around innovation
and flexibility and creativity
that we didn't think we had,
we had all along.
And we now have realized that we can.
So what have we learned?
I mean, what did we learn right away?
First of all, we learned we're not family.
The family is the toddler
walking around behind you
in the Zoom call with the pet.
The family is somebody
needing their diaper changed.
The family is making sure
you're taking care of your mom.
That's your family.
This is your team.
And we've also learned
that that separation
between family and work
has become this balancing act.
And that when we used to say,
"Well, this is my work home
and this is my family home,
and those are two
completely different things,"
for many of us, it's exactly
the same thing.
You're no longer at home and at work.
For many of us, work is at home
and the home is --
and it's confusing,
and it's creating a whole different level
of complexity and coordination
so that we understand
that it's easier actually to work
when we can separate
the work that we do as a team
from the work that we do in our family.
Furthermore, in order
to be able to do all that,
we have to recognize
that we're all adults.
And here's the deal about adults.
Adults have responsibilities,
adults have obligations.
Adults have things
that they have to commit to.
And do you know that every
single person that works for you,
from the shop floor
to the executive suite,
is a grown-up?
But we have been operating
as if they aren't.
We operate as if only the smart adults
are the people who are at the C Suite.
And as we move through the organization,
everybody sort of gets
a little dumbed down
and the rules get a lot stricter
and we have to have more control.
And the truth is, everybody's a grown-up,
we can see it now.
Everybody has all of these things
to figure out and coordinate.
And so now we're expecting
from people adult behavior.
We're now focusing on the results
that matter, not the work.
And the way we track it now
is we don't walk by and see who's working.
We pay attention to what people are doing.
And I think that that's always
been the best metric.
And you know what?
For the first time in my life,
the concept of best practices
is out the window.
And you know what?
We don't care what Google's doing
because we're not Google.
We don't care what some
other company is doing.
Nobody's doing it best.
We're all figuring it out as we go along
and we're figuring it out
for our organizations
in our teams at this time.
So in order for people to deliver
the right results,
in order for people's hard work to matter,
it has to be in the context
of what success looks like
for your organization.
So if we start to think about context,
it's really important that we think
about how we teach that.
If we can teach everybody in the company
how to read a profit and loss statement,
if we can teach them
what the different teams do,
and what they're setting out
to accomplish,
then people within their own small teams,
and within themselves,
can figure out what excellence
looks like for them.
And so then we can start operating
relatively independently
as a whole organization
because we're all moving
in the same direction,
trying to do the same thing.
And there's a really critically important
part of making that work,
and that's communication.
And everything about
communication has changed.
We tend to think
that communication is this waterfall
from the top to the bottom.
The executives would tell somebody
and the next level would tell somebody
and we'd go all the way down
to the shop floor
and everybody would understand
what's going on.
Well, it may not have worked
that well then,
but it certainly doesn't
work that well now.
So now we have to recognize
it's a different heartbeat.
What has it been before
and what should it be now?
How do we make sure that the messages
are clear and consistent?
Because that's how people operate.
That's how those adults
who get the freedom
and the responsibility to produce
great results operate best
is when they understand
what they need to know
in order to make the best decisions.
So that communication,
that skill around being
a great communicator
is something that each of us
needs to get better at.
One of the things we have to do
is think about what
the right discipline is for that.
If you used to communicate
to your team by walking by
and asking how they're doing
or if they had heard something,
you're going to have to schedule that now,
it's going to have to have discipline.
We've got to check in
with the people on the shop floor
to make sure they're hearing
what they need to hear
because it's not going
to automatically happen.
One of the ideas I have
is just jot down at the end of every day
a sentence of what worked
and what didn't work.
And you don't have to look
at it for a month.
But when you look back, over a month,
you want to look for,
"Wow, that was surprising.
I didn’t really think
that would be as effective as it is.”
Or maybe it would be, like,
"We keep trying to have
this in-person meeting in Zoom,
and it turns out
that there's 14 people on the call
and only two of them are talking.
Maybe it's an email."
So we have to rethink all of the ways,
not just the work we're doing,
but the ways we're doing it.
So now I'm starting to hear
a lot of nostalgia
around the way it used to be.
There are things we aren't doing
now that don't matter.
Maybe we don't need to go back
for five levels of approval.
Maybe we don't need to go back
and do that annual performance review.
Maybe we don't need to do
a whole bunch of things
that were part of the way we do business
that just aren't making a difference.
You know what?
The way we used to do it
not only is not the way of the future,
but we're discovering
so many wonderful things right now.
Let's not lose it.
We want to create
a new organization, new workforce,
that's excited about taking
all of the things that we've learned
using that muscle, going forward.
One of the most important
things that we can do
is realize the things
that we aren't doing now.
The stuff that we've stopped doing
and not go back and do it again.
What if we don't go back?
What if we go forward
and rethink the way we work?
Thank you.

How Netflix Escaped Going Broke And Exploded Their Business Feat. Patty McCord
we ran out of money you know people
would be like are we going to have
layoffs I'm like if we don't come up
with some money it's over that Christmas
DVD players dropped to 99 bucks and the
only marketing we could afford to do was
to put a coupon in the DVD player box
that said try Netflix for free and our
businessman and get your first DVDs in
the mail in about one bus day from when
you go to write your job
description you want to write what's
that problem and what would it take to
solve it how you go and recruit for that
is you find somebody who absolutely
loves that problem and can't wait to do
it for your company not the best
qualified person and strategy isn't what
you're going to do it's what you're not
going to do it's starting to make those
those choices about like well we could
do this and we could do this or we could
focus on one thing and do it
extraordinarily well you know the way
that the way this happened and I I have
to give credit to Unice my uh my
assistant of uh 28 years more than my
assistant I we still I'll talk to you
about like what I office Angel whatever
you yeah what office Angel yeah yeah she
she so she reads a lot I've read over a
thousand books and so this is her copy I
wanted to show you her copy and so I've
been through I've listened to your whole
book on audio I've read the entire book
reading it so I've been through your
book twice but she like some of you
can't see it but so all these things
that are where the pages are folded and
there's a different highlighting or my
highlights and then this whole entire
book I mean Unice went through this
whole thing this was several years ago
because I think it came out in
2017 right and it is so damn good uh has
anyone here read the book yet because
okay every single page has something on
it that is like an aha that's insightful
and so uh we can talk about the book we
can talk and you're doing a lot of stuff
there's there there's things with and I
do have a list of questions for you but
I I just want to let you know that we
are not married to any of this I really
want to just get your perspective don't
worry I won't follow along yeah good uh
I just want to get your perspective and
insight on um on on just business and
what makes it work and what makes it
fail and what creates a great team and
what doesn't starting with this whole
thing let's just go right into a term
that's used by a lot of people uh Brad
smart uh a players right and you are uh
you don't really like the term a players
there's a couple of ter hate most of
them um when I was when I ran my team at
Netflix uh we used to have this
whiteboard that was buzzword Bingo and
whenever we'd get an HR thing it was
like you know empowerment and the reason
why I named my book powerful was I was
really sick and tired of empowerment and
I would do these these HR meetings I'm
like yeah empowerment all of a sudden
why do we have to empower everybody cuz
we took it all away right and there's
nobody that walks around and goes you're
empowered and has a magic wand so I I'm
going to put your book back here so it's
nice and display here um and a
players I think everybody should hire a
players in every single role in your
company and but an a player in a role in
your company may or may not be an a
player in my company so I did a group I
did a a dinner with a bunch of young
entrepreneurs it was a y combinator
thing or something and one of the guys
says well you don't really mean in every
job and I said no I kind of say what I
mean and he said um yeah but you know
there's some jobs that don't really
matter and I said really which job in
your company doesn't matter you don't
want an a player like you know like say
payroll I'm like so you don't want a
really smart person playing paying all
the other smart people I said by the way
just an FYI in case you don't know this
already your finance department hates
you and he said how do you know You'
never met anybody in my company I said
you just told me a perfect stranger that
you think your head of payroll is stupid
you don't think they know you don't
think they are with
you do you know why it takes so long to
get everything out of Finance because
they don't want to make you
happy right so that's you know so so let
me let me step back for a second so I'll
I'll give you a couple of big broad
Strokes that I've learned over time if
you create a company that's a great
place to be from it'll change everything
you do okay so I did a group of 500 CEOs
in Canada one time and they had brought
their HR people and I said how many of
you are in the job that you had when you
graduated from University how many hands
went up how many of you think retention
is the most important metric to track in
your
company like said you know that's a big
fat lie
so why don't we stop doing big fat lies
and when and it led me to be a great
place to be from and so if you are
leader in your organization no matter
whether it's large or small your job is
to put together a team that creates um
that does amazing work on time with
quality that satisfies your customer and
is resume
worthy so that's you know if if everyone
on your team and first of all know that
everyone and your team's not going to be
there forever that's a big fat lie know
that you're not going to hire people
that are going to grow in the company
Google does that they they hire people
who um they think will stay in the
company 10 to 20 years and they hire
people for just brain power but remember
Google is
alphabet so like for us at Netflix
they're like you know are you going to
give me 20% of my time to think about
what I want to think I'm like hell no we
want to give people
movies we just do one thing and if it
doesn't interest you then that's okay so
Google's a player for example was never
our a player gotcha because we were very
very structured around deliverables and
time and and so everything in my book
and everything that I talk about I
learned from engineers and product
managers so what I tried to do my at
Netflix because Reed gave me permission
to do whatever I wanted to do as long as
I didn't totally screw it up I asked for
two things when I went to work with him
at Netflix no those no
 and and I got to be the referee
I got a red card a yellow card and a
green card and if I slap down the yellow
card you should worry because I got a
green I got a red one in my pocket too
um but so so what you want to do is
constantly create teams for the future
and not make do the best you can with
what you
have okay make a great company to be
from so my methodology which is in my
book which is imagine you have the most
amazing team or company in 6 to 12
months but let's take six because if
you're in a real startup you can't look
any further than six months like I like
I hate bonus programs and startups
especially like our annual bonus program
I'm like you have no clue what's going
to happen at the end of the year right
there could be a pandemic yeah anyway so
in six to 6 months you create a team
that is amazing everything is going like
you want it to be it's a Well oiled
machine everybody's rocking it we're
firing all cylinders what's happening
then that's not happening
now and then because I came from Netflix
make a movie of it right just walk
around and are there more meetings or
there less meetings are people standing
up and debating fiercely what they think
is the right thing to do or are they
have their heads down and they're just
working what does it look like what does
it feel like right where's the energy
coming from and you then reverse
engineer that okay 6 months remember
time is really important and this is the
thing we don't do with people very often
I'm going to hire an amazing guy who's
going to be amazing guy it's like o okay
like so what are they going to deliver
in six months right so in six months you
got amazing company blah blah blah blah
blah okay so then work backwards and say
well who do I have and so the Deltas are
who you hire so what are the problems
that can't be solved in 6 months by the
team that you have the team that you
have might be able to solve them in 4
years but you don't need it solved in
four years you need it solved in six
months and so when you go to write your
job
description you want to write what's
that problem and what would it take to
solve it not I need 5 to seven years of
progressive management experience in a
Ruby on Rails right not it's not full of
acronyms because that's what you sell so
I'm a marketer I'm an engineer I'm a
product manager because how you go and
recruit for that is you find somebody
who absolutely loves that problem and
can't wait to do it for your company not
the best qualified
person right so I mean I I hired
somebody one time who we were trying to
we were trying to solve a problem about
something um about matching uh movies to
people and there is this guy somebody's
likey have you seen this thing this app
that this kid made up and we think he's
a kid uh that matches people and I look
at I'm like that's pretty cool get
somebody like him I'm like why don't we
just go get him so he was a programmer
in um Phoenix at a bank and his website
was half his woodworking projects and
the other half was his Netflix app so I
brought him in and at the end of the
interview I said he goes how did it go
and I'm like we love you so we're going
to let's move you out he's like you
you're going to hire me to do what I
love to
do and move me in my family like are you
kidding I'm like no pretty much you're
our guy he's like
but know but what about programming I'm
like you know banks will always be there
you you can always go back he's a VP
there now wow wow it's just a really
creative and I don't know what his I
know he didn't have a PhD from MIT yeah
he just had yeah well you you you you
talk a lot about people that love to
solve problems and you talk a lot about
problems
and I always think of businesses solving
problems for a profit right and that
every day there's going to be a boatload
of problems and I've even taken it so
far as to you know people have this
belief that everything's going to be a
you know a smooth
running you know fine o tuned oil
machine I mean all the analogies of and
it's it's a cluster until it's as
smooth as silk and it usually isn't as
smooth as silk and as soon as it is it's
only for a short period of time like
there's a sign up there that says my
life is an entrepreneur that Hugh McLoud
did that says hell yeah I love love that
when I could see it from where I was
sitting no no this
this there's like two that say hell yes
the rest are like oh and so that's
usually I think there it is you know so
I I look I've because I've worked with
so many different stages of companies I
like in the first early early stage the
first hundred people you hire you want
them to have a couple of things you want
them to be able to work very hard
because all of your problems are
problems of difficulty right so your
whiteboards aren't full of solutions and
strategies they're full of not that not
that not that cuz you don't know right I
remember somebody saying to me why
didn't management see this coming I'm
like we make it
up we didn't we thought we saw it but we
didn't see it okay they work hard
they're the most smart smartest people
you can get for what you can afford to
pay them and they believe yeah and in
the first hundred people the belief part
is really really critical because all
startups are kind of stupid ideas and if
they were obvious somebody else would
already be doing them so that's why you
hire your sister's boyfriend because he
thinks it's a great idea right and and
people work hard and they they get and
then should you get I was thinking about
a term I call it step functional growth
step functional instead of L everybody
thinks it's going to be linear right
it's just
gonna and what happens is if you get
that first hundred people and you get a
product that people want and you get
enough money to pull it off and that
moment is there then almost instantly
your problems are of
scale right and then when you get to
problems of scale you go back to the
team and go how should we solve this
they're like work hard without food or
water and beer like or we could plan or
we could strategize and strategize most
people in the early stage think means
planning and strategy isn't what you're
going to do it's what you're not going
to do it's starting to make those those
choices about like well we could do this
and we could do this we could rent
movies we could rent games we could rent
do Sports we could do porn we could do
or we could focus on one thing and do it
extraordinarily well right and so then
when you get to that phase then you do
the same thing I just said okay when we
want to do that by the end of the year
okay do we can we do it with the team
we've
got probably not okay so it's not that
we need some grown-ups in the room we
but we might need some people with have
had more experience with
scale right and there might be what for
us when I looked around we had all these
teams of people that we had these very
clever names for you know the what was
it the content quality team or something
all they did was watch movies at their
desks I'm like you know can we get our
family members to do this like why are
we paying people to do this um anyway so
you you look around you find out there's
all these jobs you thought you had that
you really don't really scale and you
don't really need them and they're
wonderful people and they've made a huge
contribution but they can't do it yeah
so that's the first hardest always
hardest parts of a moving a startup as
you
scale right which is not that you don't
have smart people who aren't a players
and aren't capable it's usually timing
yeah okay second thing it it is is we
hire people to do something we hire
people to build stuff two years they
build something amazing and now it's
done right you don't need another one of
those so you say hey Mr Innovative
Builder we'd like you to do maintenance
on this product
and then that Innovative Builder is
miserable and it's our fault because we
couldn't find another exciting thing for
him or her to do right right so why
aren't you taking care of my career
right and so then you learn about I am
the queen of good
goodbyes I'm very very good at it my
best friends including me are people
I've said goodbye to or have said
goodbye to me right Reed's my best
friend and so that's where as a leader
you have to it's you're in charge of
creating that amazing team it's your
only
job so let's talk about uh two ways I
want to come to the Good by things so
Dan Sullivan who's sitting over there in
the corner uh the disruptive one over
there yeah uh he uh has this he has many
quotes uh one of the many great quotes
uh one is the skills to get you out of
Egypt are not the same skills to get you
to the promised land that's right and so
another way of saying it the people that
get you to one place are not the same
ones that are going to get you to
another that's right and I think that's
always been the hardest for me I think
that's hard for most people here in this
room and it's one of the and and I've
had people that have spoken here at the
100K group that once they've reached 100
million in Revenue they've
said one guy in particular said I could
never believe it when I was first told
this by all the management people that
have reached out that everyone that
works for you is no longer going to be
with you he's like well there's got to
be a few that are really great and
they're like no you're going to and I
still have a I I still grapple with that
you know it's like I've had people that
have been in my company for many many
years through many different stages so
do we yeah and
so like I think it'd be really helpful
for people here to learn how when to
just it's F it's time to say goodbye or
the realization that you really want to
help help the person because
most I really try to nurture genius
Network in this group to be givers yeah
and the challenge of being a giver is
you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings
you try to give opportunities to
everybody yeah but let me let me give
you a different perspective
um if you know there's a couple of
reasons why people fail right it doesn't
work out one of them is you made a bad
hire okay you just hired the wrong
person and in startups that's easy to do
because you don't really know what the
job is
right so you hire the person you like
that think is really smart they have an
idea in the interview it seems
reasonable you hire them it turns out
you are completely wrong and they're the
wrong person okay so um that happens all
the time right that is absolutely no
one's fault but yours the person you
hired is has no you know there's no they
did nothing wrong you hired the wrong
person right and what I've learned to do
is with people like that is to be able
to to say in the interview this is risky
cuz I don't really know what the job is
and I think you're going to be the right
person but if it turns out in six months
it doesn't work out no harm no fail
right and then that person has that
expectation right I remember hiring
somebody this do you love and do you
love him is he great is he great don't
you want to have a beer with him I'm
that's the cutest kid I've ever had in
my life he's not qualified right I know
but you know if each of us works hard
and works with him we can bring him up
to speed I'm like oh there's a good
return on the investment for the company
we're going to add another headcount
with another salary and we're going to
take 20% out of each of you to make sure
that he comes up to speed for the job
that he's not qualified to
do but I like him too and by the way I'm
not running the team you are so good
luck with that yeah and of course he
didn't work out this is a funny story so
he didn't work
out and I said to him and I said to him
in the interview I'm like you know it's
a little bit iffy here bony so we get
ready to go and he's in he's practically
crying cuz I'm firing him right and I'm
like no we aren't where do you live I
call a friend of mine at Apple I get him
another job blah blah blah cuz he's a
great kid and he's great he's just not
qualified for the job we have so he
comes into his exit interview and he
brought me a bush like from the nursery
a
Shrubbery and he I'm like oh you brought
me a a Shrubbery no one's ever done that
he said yeah my wife said how come
you're bringing that that fired
you flowers
so that's thing one you you hired the
wrong person thing two is um they finish
something mhm right you hire them to do
something and they're done and there
really isn't another thing for them to
do that's like that um I remember saying
goodbye to our last QA engineer because
we automated automated all the QA
instead of doing you know manual QA and
she's weeping and moaning and she's like
I'm so surprised and I'm like are you
kidding me like I've been sitting next
to you in every meeting for the last
year we talking about automating Q hey I
didn't think it'd be me I'm like well
who' you think it would be and I'm like
and I'm like how dare you cry you're
from Netflix you know chin up and go get
a
raise you're the last one you know why
cuz you're the best
one you wouldn't even be here this long
if it wasn't for you so number one of
the good goodbye thank
you even if you hate
them thank you for the contribution that
you made to our country company third
reason is you turnover
management mhm and the new management
style is different than the old
management style there's loyalties
there's this there's that and so that's
just tough and so what you got to do
with that one if you're a leader um is
when you hire that new manager and they
turn a lot of people over which
sometimes they do like I remember one
guy saying I want to give you a a he'd
been here like six weeks I want to go
over presentation with you on how I want
to optimize my team and then who you
should tell me who it is I should
present it to an upper management to get
it approved I'm
like 6 weeks you did a
PowerPoint like
no put together the right team he's like
I want to do team building I'm like
great go build a team like we're not
going to go do trust
Falls you know go bowling I don't know I
don't care I don't it's your team go
build your team so those are typically
the reasons why people don't work out
and here's what you can do about those
tell
them tell them Joe man I think you might
be the right guy to do this job I really
do and you've done so much great stuff
for us and but honestly I don't know so
give you the opportunity all the help
you can get but you know we have to have
the right person
person so you know for us at Netflix for
example um the DVD by mail guys and gals
were amazing brilliant fabulous the best
in the world none of them were qualified
to do anything on streaming right none
of them they didn't get to transition
over it was just a competely different
set of problems did most of them leave
or did they have to be let go depends on
who they were um so I'll give you an
example a concrete example I'm very
pragmatic I give you lots of real
examples our um it team that ran our
data center for DVD by mail it was a
physical data center that was in Santa
Clara that was near us right and um the
we we're we're talking about oh we did
an exercise at the executive staff
because we had grown 30% quarter over
quarter 3/4 in a row compounded right
yeah and so Read's like well we need to
have a discussion about what goes to
 in a hand basket if this doesn't
work I'm like you know for once what if
it
worked like what if this kept going so
he's like I don't know anybody want to
do what Patty says they're all like yeah
so CFO goes to the Whiteboard does top
line
revenue 30% growth quot recorder you
know comp out he's like
 so much money I mean I'm like Barry
you know might want to step outside then
come back in when you're a little calm
he's like Jesus God it's so
much so at the time um so Ted who's the
head of Netflix now he's co- CEO he's
looking at the content spend and he's
like you know in those days we would say
someday we'll be as big as
HBO
someday and Ted goes you guys we
HBO next
year right we're like oh we me in our
lifetimes right
and then our head of engineering says
um that's 2/3 of the US internet
bandwidth I'm like uh uh stay after I
said I'm like Neil does anybody know how
to do that he's she's like no don't
think so like oh what do we do and
he goes we we're going to have to be in
the cloud and I'm like does anybody in
the cloud he's like I think Amazon's
doing some stuff I'm like can we call
them but they're the enemy but they
aren't the enemies I'm like does our
team is there anybody in our team that
knows how to do this no don't think so
so we go to the IT team and we say
here's our problem and they say don't
worry why don't you guys go exec
something and we'll build a club and I
thought if anybody could it's
you but not by next
year and if we couldn't do it we would
lose the opportunity h
right so so my role in the company was
to say how do we put together the team
that gets us there we cannot miss an
opportunity because we have the wrong
team what was so instrumental with you
having this ability and learning this
skill and being able to do it because I
imagine there's uh there's a quite a bit
of Art and Science mixed together in
this you know the the cool thing about
Netflix was it was the first time that I
was an equal member of the executive
team like I I represented normal people
yeah you know when we'd test something
they'd be like look at this this shows
what your buffering speed is I'm like
nobody gives a about buffering
speed I just want to watch my movie like
no yeah you know normal here's what a
normal person would do in this situation
um and I did a lot of testing uh because
I could I was a consumer like everybody
else so that was thing one and I was
really really involved in the business
because we were making it up like would
subscription really work I mean that was
a really scary business model because
between marketing and cost of goods and
labor it took $70 before Payback right
because we had to buy three DVDs and the
people to open them and the postage and
all that kind of stuff right so the
outlay for every new customer is like
$70 and on the subscription model they
didn't pay back for 9 months to a year
wow right you really negative for a
while yeah we we were to we totally bet
the farm right so we were always like
margins were this then but I understood
what a margin was and and and because I
was so enamored with doing this instead
of stupid HR um I I we just taught
everybody how to read a
p&l I just figured if I could do it we
shouldn't hire anybody who can't do this
so we'd have a meeting every Friday in
the parking lot and we'd go over all the
metrics and so when it turned out that
we ran out of money you know people
would be like are we going to have
layoffs I'm like anybody got any other
ideas I mean you know where it goes like
if we don't come up with some
money it's over MH and the only thing we
have to spend is salary and they're like
we don't like that I'm like I know but
so anyway
um then once I kind of got going so then
we laid off a third of the company and
then that Christmas we left third of the
company in October that Christmas DVD
players dropped to 99 bucks wow and if
you were alive that Christmas you had a
DVD player under the tree and the only
marketing we could afford to do was to
put a coupon in the DVD player box that
said try Netflix for
free and our business
went wow now remember we still don't
have any money yeah so we're doing twice
as much work with the third as many
people and it was more
fun and so that's when I made you know I
driving to work with Reed I'm like I am
so stoked about coming to work today
this is the hardest I've ever worked in
my life he's like I know what is it hey
I hope you're enjoying this video and I
want to let you know that I have a new
book that's come out and if you'd like
to get it absolutely free there's a link
below in the description or you can wait
till the end of this video or you can
simply go to Joe free book.com and you
can get a copy
there okay that's the one one thing I
want to like H having that sort of
attitude instilled so two two things one
I think you know I'll speak for myself
always hoping there's this wonderful
amazing talent that I bring into my own
organization then there's me you know
who's pretty much the what's that um
that despair.com one that says
dysfunction and it says the only
commonality and all of your
dissatisfying relationships is you
that's right so
so who do we have to be in order to
build a good team because the term
culture the first you know four words
are cult right so there's culture what
what is a culture what what does that
even mean I'll speak to both things one
of them is I'm kind of okay with the
cult thing I mean not in the not in the
really bad way but it really is
something you kind of need to buy into
that's why we wrote the culture deck mhm
was Reed said let's have an offsite and
talk about values and I'm like let's not
you know we have a problem to build and
we just don't have time to go sit around
and like Naval gaze and Wordsmith some
document right and I said but you know
what what I will do this time Reed let's
write down
behaviors right if we say Integrity what
does that mean what would you see
somebody do if it was be if in our first
drafts of those behaviors one of them
was
IQ like cuz I was like can we write we
really don't want stupid people and then
we're like that's probably not that
great of
but but we meant it right we meant it we
wanted people to be able to move along
we rewrote that part of the culture deck
six times because what we would do at an
offsite a management offsite we'd say
okay let's talk about um reliability
tell me somebody on your team that has
done that last week tell me somebody on
your team that's tell me somebody on
your team tell me somebody that you know
in the company who's not reliable and
what do we do about it right so that was
when I started realizing that if we
focus on behaviors and what we what we
want as a company I mean we didn't want
everybody to have a company like that
the Netflix culture deck isn't a Bible
it was our culture deck right right it
was like this is what you can expect
from I would tell people when I hired
them I'm like here's who we are and this
is this is your if your manager doesn't
act like this and you have a right to
call them on any part of this culture so
um so we started writing it down right
that was the other big thing that we did
was we wrote things down and then we
played against it and we paid attention
to it probably at a management meeting
at least two or three times a year and
we would really really focus on it and
so when we had for example so after the
layoff we wrote the chapter called um
high
performance and once we actually had a
company with a lot of high performance
and that took me my team 5 years I had
to have a team of of recruiters who
understood the business and didn't just
fill positions and they had to be really
good so I I hired my best Head Hunter
and paid her extraordinarily well to
teach my people how to head hunt cuz I'm
a recruiter it's like this isn't brain
surgery right right there's and and Reed
said to me goes I said you know I'm
going to hire Jessica remember her he's
like she's great I'm like we're going to
pay her half a million dollars nobody in
HR makes a half a million dollars I'm
like profit Center you watch wow she's
going to hire five VPS okay I had to do
that I had to get my CFO and my lawyers
to to agree with me that instead of
doing performance Improvement plans
which I think are the
cruestv plan the reason I decided to
give up the performance Improvement plan
was I've been in HR for 30 years people
sue you CU they're
pissed because you didn't tell them the
truth you didn't tell them you know we
may not need you anymore bunky we love
you but we may not need you anymore and
by the way we have some time to figure
that it team they're like what do you
mean will we not be here when we move to
the cloud I'm like maybe not but we got
nine months figured out yeah okay so
what you asked me about culture I'm very
Margaret meat about culture
it's how you behave how you behave with
each other what the team what the system
rewards you know Reeds would say it's
that you pick up a piece of paper off
the floor and nobody ever asks you to MH
right it's that you're responsible for
each other that you're reliable so
that's how so once we had high
performance team then we could do
freedom and responsibility so we go
public our CFO sends me a copy of the
the travel policy the time off policy
and the EXP policy dear Patty Reed says
that I have to run this by although I
don't know why this doesn't have
anything to do with HR these are all
Finance policies and you should just do
what I say like okay so I'm looking at
them and they're the same policies we
all have we all steal them from each
other there hasn't been a new policy
written in 50 years so I'm thinking well
um let's do expense policies so any
expense over 4K has to be approved by
somebody in finance
right so I'm I've got people with phds
in math they know what greater than 4K
is okay so what they're going to do if
they need 12 is they're going to go to
finance and ask for you know four
approvals at 3K each yeah right and I'm
and I'm they're going to be using their
PhD math brains to figure out how to
 with the person and finance who
doesn't even know why they need the
money
anyway it's just just stupid right and
so instead of you say hey by the way uh
so what I did and this took years was I
had to get rid of all those people in
finance whose job it was to approve
things if it's your job to approve
things your power comes from saying
no yeah geez that engineer that engineer
went in 4k and I told him I don't think
so right so I to get rid of all them and
replace them with more senior people who
could sit in the staff meetings and say
by way we budgeted 4K for individual
contributor expenses and we're running 6
and a half so how do you want to manage
that with the budget because the
budget's just a projection it's not you
know Bible so that's the finance then um
time off have I ever fired a salary
employee for being tardy or
absent No in fact I've said goodbye to
people who work all the time because
they're weird
you know what I'm saying it's like
you're great by the way I this is you
know if you had a life then maybe you
wouldn't be so
exhausted um
so you know and and oh by the way if I
have a time off policy then I have to
have people on my team who do two things
police it and make
exceptions cuz there's you have a policy
then all you do is like well you know
we're not really supposed to do this and
I'm going to have to run this up the
ladder and get
approvals and the second thing and and
it's like the finance thing like why
would I have people on my team figure
out how your people on your team work
yeah I it's so I that sort of gave me
the mindset of like we should push all
this stuff as far down as we
can right we should be at the team level
mhm right um and and then when we got
rid of it of course people are like
people are going to never work people
are going to work all the time people
are I'm like so you know I'm we're going
to pay you an annual salary so if you
only want to work six months a year
we're going to call that
part-time you don't get to like
arbitrarily take six the other thing
about this stuff when people ask me
about this if you have people who are
really
engaged they want to do it right I mean
so you the pandemic right oh my God if
we're not supervising the moment how
will we keep track of stuff well you'd
look at
results like my HR friends are like what
HR metrics do you think are important
I'm like the
p&l you know if something's not
happening that somebody said was going
to happen when you dig into it it's
probably a people issue mhm but it's
probably not
motivation yeah right it's probably not
cuz you're unhappy so let's talk about
that so you don't you don't have
vacation time off uh you don't like
incent you don't you don't track it
don't track it right so I'm supposed to
be this Innovative Guru these days so
like when I left Netflix I was like
what am I going to do now I'm working
every day for my whole life I never did
anything Innovative I didn't I just
stopped doing stupid stuff
it's a very good idea which stop stupid
stuff which is what every one of you is
doing right in your and so I would I
remember um when I used to do Keynotes
this is one of my favorite stories we uh
Steve Jobs had called Reed and said by
the way we have this new device that
we're launching and it's going to be
able to stream video and we'd like you
guys to be partners with us to launch
this new device um it's going to be
transformational
so Reed gets the head of product and me
together and he goes you know steah blah
blah blah blah and I'm like well um
when's it going to happen and what is it
and why is it transformational and
Read's like well it's
Apple so we don't know any of that
 and I'm like well you know we are
going global da d d i mean we were kind
of maxed out with projects and do we
know what technology is what the sex
stack how do we do it he's like I don't
know so he says and if you guys say we
can't do it we won't do it so we go back
to Neil's team and he explains and you
know you can see you guys all know this
the twinkle in an engineer's eye when
you say it can't be
done you know they're
like so I'm like all right I'll get out
the Midnight Oil and the cuts and we'll
just pick a team of people to do it
so it's the iPad of course and Steve's
launching the iPad at Mac world are we
invited no yeah and there were like
seven people who are allowed to go over
to Apple and observe the device on a
velvet so when of them comes back I'm
like how was it he's
like okay we launch it I come into the
meeting I'm like oh my God you guys it
is transformational the kid next to me
streaming SpongeBob in his high chair he
can't even read I mean and oh it's it is
it is it's touch technology is so
compelling right it's it's like Primal I
can't wait till I go into my media room
and swipe my wall and the guys are like
they start riffing like jazz musicians
like you're not going to have to get
up you know no no no another one says
you you get take out your iPhone put
your thumb on it the mudo meter will say
Patty are you sad you know and
immediately a comedy will show starring
all your favorite people and I remember
being in that room
thinking if it was at the right place at
the right time with the right people in
the room that can
happen why not
me how these guys get have all the
fun if they if they can think of a whole
new way to do this why can't I think of
a whole new way to do what I do so what
I did was um when I started throwing
things away was I did what everybody
else did in the product I would say look
I can't really AB test time off but all
the lawyers are telling me that we're
going to get crippled with lawsuits
because men are going to take more time
off than women or or U my HR friends are
like this is going to be a morale issue
you know people and I'm like but I don't
think so I mean I think you guys are
grown up enough to do this but let's try
it for 6 months and if it turns out that
they're right and I'm wrong then we'll
just go back to the way everybody else
does it and we'll call it best
practices right right so that's just how
it came about right and so as soon as we
started doing those kind of experiments
and the world didn't fall you those Sky
didn't fall then it was
just we just kept doing it so so with
delegation like when you there's a lot
of people you had to hire and just put
them in charge and let things let them
do their thing and there's probably been
a lot of Errors a lot of mistake a lot
of guidance a lot of Education uh how
are you able to uh let go in intelligent
ways or what what were some of the way I
love love to hear in the Netflix culture
deck that's the chapter called context
not control MH so we were doing a an
investor presentation one time after we
had gone public and each of the heads
that the organizations were presenting
to the investors what was going on with
them what their goals blah blah blah
blah blah blah and I'm sitting back with
um one of the VPS and I'm like damn you
know I work here I'm learning stuff and
she said yeah can you believe we go to
all this effort for a bunch of strangers
and we don't do it for ourselves which
begat new employee College which was
every quarter all the new hires got
together and every head of every
organization said here's here's who we
are here's what are what's important to
us and we just gave people the context
around the business so it was the second
phase of the metrics meeting yeah right
where we would teach people how the
businesses inter change it was funny cuz
we all thought this will be great right
I'll put together a presentation I won't
have to do anything every quarter I'll
just whoop it out show up and do it
every quarter it's a business chape Ted
called me up and he godamn
it I can't use my slide deck got to do a
whole new one so it's context okay right
and so it's about for example I mean
here's some practical ideas um if you
have people in marketing and engineering
and product and the what whoever the
leaders are in those organizations
should rotate into the other
organizations for their meetings and
talk to them about it and you should say
when somebody goes you know I think the
people in marketing have their head
screwed on backwards what they're doing
is stupid I'm like what they say when
you ask
them so get off your butt yep and go
find somebody in marketing and say help
me understand so my favorite phrase is
why do you believe that to be
true uh another one I'll teach you is
when an employee says I think that was a
dumb decision right I why management
made that decision so you ask them two
questions the second is more important
the first one is if you were in
management what decision would you have
made more importantly if you were in
management what information would you
want to have to make a good decision so
you teach people the scientific method
and if you do that over and over and
over and over and over again then when
they say they know to when they open
their mouth to about something
they bet or have an idea about how they
would do it differently gotcha so yeah
I'm like I'm like you know um everybody
says uh lowest common denominator and
pay attention to the wiers I'm like you
know
complainers they're dime a dozen problem
solvers problem solvers that's who you
want and so when when you go back to
like having people in your organization
that stay with you um there's a couple
things that make those people successful
one of them is they're very curious
about the business and they're curious
about things that are other than what
you hired them
for right so you we tend to hire people
for roles in very small niches I'm sure
I I hear this from the military all the
time like the more you learn about the
broader team the more you learn about
the div the more you learn about what
everybody is doing then you know what
your role is on the team and how you
operate and how the communication works
right so so they're curious and the
other thing is they solve problem s yeah
could Reed have done what he did without
you never never you know my my
ex-husband's family would always say um
one of their digs against me because
they would be like what is it you do you
you plan parties like you know and they
would say um well it's a good thing you
met Reed Hastings or you'd be nobody I
said you know it's a good thing Reed
Hastings met me we're very yin and yang
and it was really really helpful in the
beginning because Reed is very very
datadriven he's very analytical and he's
very logical and so I would say I would
be able to say to him and this took
years by the way he's like I don't
understand why everybody's so upset you
know this is what I said I'm like I was
there I know what you said I will quote
you word for word do you want to hear
what they
heard explain that because there is
here's here's an example he's like I
want I don't know why people understand
that you know things have changed and
business moved on and the decisions that
we made have changed I'm like well okay
so most people hear your decisions at
the quarterly company meeting so in this
particular case you have reversed
yourself 180 deges and they're here
going what the
 right so we together um I would
learn to go you know that yeah I know
what you mean but that's not working and
he was really really great about saying
the decision I made was
wrong and here's what's most important
here's the information I had when I made
the decision and here's what turned out
to be the what actually happened yeah
and so that kind of modeling if you
model that stuff all the
time then the people will that rise to
the top will rise to the top cuz they'll
say I don't agree with you here's what I
think we should do instead or here the
consequences of of if we do what you say
but they can't just whine about it so
the the attitude of playing to to win
versus playing not to lose uh what what
where I always find myself and I'm not
sure I'd love to I'm asking as a
question for myself and and also for
everyone else where I feel like I need
to either bring on new Talent upgrade my
team do something is when this belief
where everyone's like playing not too uh
they're not playing the win they're
playing not to lose and then of all all
of a sudden the growth gets stalled and
then there becomes this sort of tension
I would say my advice to you would be
wrong
start boss explain that um first you
want to start with what does winning
team look like and what's the time frame
for doing that okay and then ask
yourself that
question because
otherwise you will be play not to lose
MH right I mean we were so lucky at
Netflix and I know I'm talking a lot
about Netflix 10 years ago I coach a lot
of companies um but like if we didn't
win we just death right you know aren't
you afraid of Amazon doing streaming
aren't you afraid of Apple going into
streaming it's like yeah of course we
are I mean they're amazing companies
with really talented people but if they
screw it up they'll go sell phones we
screwed up or dead yeah how many times
did you get close to death I mean I
would imagine more than once yeah yeah I
mean uh and where where how do you so in
a situation like with
Reed where would you give each other
slack CU I imagine there were some times
where it's just like I'm you know what
kept you from jumping ship or making or
having the emotional stress we just we
taught each other a lot and then I mean
you know when when I left so basically
what he said so we had a we had a ritual
uh every year we took the company to
Sundance and at Sundance Reed and I
would buy a bottle of wine and we would
say would you hire me again for next
year am I the right at one point no it
was really really really beginning and
one of his habits was sort of public
humiliation and I said something he goes
yeah mord I could fire you in a hot
minute and I brought him in a room I'm
like news flash I could quit in
a hot minute you know you're not the
only game in town so um and I'm not
doing this anymore you you brought me
here so if I'm going to fail the worst
thing that could happen is that I would
be
surprised right don't let me do that
don't humiliate me if you don't think
I'm the one you just got to tell me and
he said okay I'll do that for you if
you'll do it for me I've never run a
company like this so every year at
Sundance in January we'd have a bottle
of wine and have that conversation the
wine got a lot more
expensive um and I remember the year we
went to to streaming or dvd by I'm like
he's like yeah we're going to have to
hire all these people and drivers and
you know warehouse workers and all that
kind of stuff and I said you know to be
honest with you I'm not your gal I don't
even know what minimum wage
is I have I mean maybe they have to be
bonded I don't know anything about truck
drivers and you know this is big this is
is going to scale pretty fast he's like
yeah you're going to be terrible at
that and he's like but if I hire
somebody that's really good at that
they're not going to be really good at
talking to The Tech Guys because
engineers and me you know I would say to
them does that sound stupid to you just
say it out loud again there just ask
yourself would your grandma say that's a
smart that's a smart idea Joe she'd say
what the so anyway engineers and I
and he said but they wouldn't understand
them so let this year um you hire
somebody that's really good at that and
if that doesn't work out then I'll
replace you right and then when I left
finally 14 it was 14 years cuz two years
as a contractor um it was on the cusp of
uh Reginal content did you did you want
to leave no no I I mean I thought I'd be
there forever but it was just after the
you guys remember the quicker debacle
anybody who remembers that when we
decided to separate the by mail from the
streaming company we're going to call
the DVD by mail company
quickster was a total disaster it was a
complete total disaster and we were
fighting you know it's like well we're
going to separate $9 for this $9 for
that I'm like we're going to double the
price in the biggest recession in
history are you crazy so price of a
latte I'm like
hello Mr CEO private jet you know in
Arkansas you ain't buying lattes yeah so
anyway
um
so we were going to separate them out
they're going to be a separate company
we're have a separate CEO we divided the
company they started recruiting from us
there was all this nasty nasty that
was happening in between and what
happened looking back it's a really
interesting MBA case was it was the
first customer Revolt
online I mean I remember waking up in
the morning like in the Wall Street
Journal and there's a quote you know in
all caps from like uh customer Joe Blow
says Netflix has screwed me I'm
like this a Wall Street
Journal and people quit in droves and
they had nowhere to go wow I mean people
quit that there was there was no other
options like screw you Netflix huh so
all of our plans for all and at that
time Reed was
he's CEO of the
year you know we W the business is
growing 30% quarter over quarter we go
into like are we the best executive team
on the planet probably what you know
what yeah
what cuz you've seen this where you're
like the darling and then they hate you
then they hated us I mean they hated us
and it was just cruel and heartless and
so the BET like we always made big bets
we always bet forward um the BET was
original
programming and so if original
programming was going to work then the
powers shift from the and the company
would go from the technology to do
streaming to Hollywood and content okay
and I'm not the Hollywood
gal how did you guys filter for
everything that ended up showing up how
much I mean how the hell did you make
decisions on what goes what doesn't
because that has to be there has to be
such a process to that to figure out
what's just how to decide what the
public wants uh what's going to be we're
geeks we just it's data we AB tested all
the time all the time all the time all
the time I mean in the I'm sure still
that if we looked at all our Netflix um
all of our Netflix presentations to each
of us we'd probably have 15 different
versions so well let's talk about the
marketing the subscription model I am
imagine you were one of the biggest
creators of everything going to a
subscription not everything but a lot so
so scary yeah I mean it was so scary I
mean the the the studios were like hey
Netflix good luck with making your own
content we're Disney yeah I mean we
think we know what we're doing and oh by
the way how are you going to get Kevin
spacy to work with you
this is before Kevin Spacey was bad
news and and we did and we we we used
the model that we used for
employees which was um a few good things
done really well with a lot of talent
and pay well mhm so we just changed the
model I mean that's what that's the
whole strike right now you and I were
talking about earlier it's like we just
ch changed the model completely and then
you know like Blockbuster
it took the studios like a couple of
years to realize oh
 we you know the the other thing I
think that's really important for all of
you a good lesson from what we did was
we were customer
obsessed I mean like if you had an idea
and you could so this is part of the
culture right yeah I mean even back in
the DVDs just con we rejected anybody
who wanted to build a really great team
you you're the size of your org chart
you know um it just if you you could not
put forth an idea that wasn't on behalf
of the customer period end of story wow
I mean like that so that would that
Obsession made leadership a really
different thing right because I'd be
like I don't hear your idea having any
effect on our consumer want to help me
understand why you need 22 more
Engineers yeah cuz what are they going
to work on that's going to make the
service better
right and the beautiful thing about that
particular product CU I've worked on a
lot of other ones is um we're all
customers MH I did a bunch of work with
Warby Parker um back when they were and
so my Warby Parker story is I go to
visit them they're the glasses company
uh they're in this shitty building in
New York and I say to the guy at the in
the bottom I'm like do you know where
War I don't know six or seven I don't
know and I walk in and it's just this
Dusty dirty New York warehouse and in
the corner is their store and it's made
of pallets right and the glasses are all
hanging on the pallets and it's packed
it's completely Word of
Mouth completely word of mouth and so
when I was coaching Consulting with them
they're like hey we think it'd be a
really cool idea to open stores I'm like
stores brick and mortar stores that's
insane and it was really interesting to
watch how that business turned an online
Phenom into a brick and mortar
experience yeah right and should they
that was a great here's a great example
like should they when they decide to
open
stores I go and I interview with all
their Executives and one they tell me
this is a strategy and they tell me this
is the guy that's going to do the store
step for us and I look at everybody's
CVS and I'm like I mean this guy doesn't
have any experience so I'm just going to
tell you I'm going to be honest at the
end of the day when I tell you this
guy's not going to be able to do it so
at the end of the day I come back and
I'm like well if you hire somebody from
the Gap they're going to have a lot of
experience in cookie cutter cookie
cutting Gap stores and it'll be
efficient it'll be effective the
customer will understand it you know
they'll know what they're expecting
it'll be you know but I'm like this
guy he he breathes the company he knows
the customer yeah right he knows who
wants the Hipster frames versus who
wants the you know stunner shades I mean
and so if you look at Warby Parker
stores there's a lot of similarities in
all of them but they're very very
um very particular to every B every city
they're in the Warby Parker store in
Nashville is covered with guitars the
Warby Parker store in uh noi Valley in
San Francisco has like a lot of dog
dishes and they you can take a picture
of your dog with glasses
and it was just really fun to see other
businesses pelaton I worked with pelaton
at the beginning um who else I did I did
a couple of years of just Consulting
with event bright what and by the way
we'll take questions too so if some of
you have some questions and let's get
ready for that um what's what what are
some companies that you absolutely
admire their culture and how they do
things right now you know it's hard
because people want
it's kind of like the question is who's
doing best practices Yeah well yeah I
guess I guess yeah you're probably right
let me let me take you to the um let's
go to the pandemic right so when I did
my keynoting right after I wrote my book
after every talk people would come up to
me in the back and go oh God what you're
talking about is so logical and it's so
reasonable and it's so obvious but we
can't um cuz we're regulated we can't
cuz we're in Europe we can't our CEO
won't let us we can't our CFO won't let
us we couldn't possibly work from
home that would be so radical we can't
give them freedom and responsibility we
can't take away the pro policies we
can't do this we can't and then the
pandemic happened 48 hours later but
he's working from home like and and so
now when I talk to those folks I'm like
you had that muscle all the time you
could have done it years before and
guess what but you know you now you can
go and guess what everybody did when you
told them to go home and work they went
home and
worked because people want to work that
that whole you know the whole Chief
happiness officer perk made me
crazyc and you know I remember
interviewing this person in the city I'm
like oh and you're you're the chief
happiness officer I'm like what is it
that
you do
well as you notice there's a lot of
products in the lady's room I'm like I
just totally read it in my hair it looks
great but um and I do I do t-shirts and
because if we don't you know one of our
employees is going to walk out the door
turn right go two two blocks down and
you know join another company for better
beer I'm
like don't let the door hit
him somebody's going to leave you for a
better beer bye and then find out when
their happy hour is and go to their
place cuz they have better beer right um
so I said to them I'm like okay here's
your
assignment F and this was at I think
this was at
stripe uh I said I want each of you to
find three people in the company that
have a reputation for being really
amazing that everybody you know it
doesn't matter really title but people
who are like like oh yeah he's great I
mean I I love working with that person
or I love working with her she's amazing
and I said ask them to tell you a story
of something they did that they felt
made a difference for the company and
the customer and every single story will
be about something hard something what
hard hard well they're not going to all
that day we went home and the macademia
nuts and the cookies were so fresh I I
wanted to see let's see uh the beer was
amazing there's this um we knew we were
doing good at Netflix because I used to
go across the street with my um with my
shopping
cart if we had like achieved a milestone
and I would get beer and we knew like if
I get imported
beer like oh man not cor light again I'm
like you
know Roi people let me read this part
this is um so I
think all right so great teams relish a
challenge so this is a quote great teams
are made when things are hard great
teams are made when you have to dig deep
when I'm hiring I look for someone who
gets really excited about the problems
we have to solve you want them to wake
up in the morning God this is hard I
want to do this and then you want people
who absolutely love problem solving
so how do you identify that early on
before you hire them oh it's pretty easy
so one thing you need to get really
really good at that most people don't
put a lot of energy into is interviewing
um so I interviewed Astro Teller who's
the head of Google X before he was there
no when he was there and he came running
up to the interview we're sitting here
like this on his rollerblades and he's
like what's your favorite interview
question I'm like against not how I
interview AST he's like sell me this
microphone I'm like you're selling
microphones here why would you ask me
it's like my favorite question cuz I
want to find out if they're creative I'm
like this just the dumbest question like
it doesn't have anything to do with what
you're doing I just so I hate trick
questions the way I interview is I take
something on somebody's resume and I
pull the thread right oh wow that's
amazing Joe you were a part of launching
that product I use it all the time it's
terrific so um you weren't a manager or
director oh you're an individual
contributor that's great and you're
singularly responsible for bringing it
over the edge how many people are on
400 did you do it on time well no but we
weren't that like I mean how what would
you done to get it on time what went
wrong well my boss was
this you're not a problem
solver okay I hope you found that video
awesome and useful so if you want to get
a free copy of my book I want you to
click here and if you want to watch some
more videos that will be useful and
awesome click here go ahead they're over
here do it
now come on thank you watch them

People First Transformation | Patty McCord | Talent Summit 2021
[Music]
[Applause]
i'm delighted this morning to
be uh joined by my i suppose my good
friend and co-conspirator as rob would
call patty
and just before patty comes online and
and it's quite a surreal kind of way to
be starting the talent somewhat standing
talking in a room to myself but it's
probably not that different than what
i'm used to
nobody listens to me anyway so paddy
has had as most of you guys know an
extensive career
um working with companies of all sizes
and i think the one thing she has always
said to me is that she has watched over
those years how companies become
slow and and complacent and how
employees can equally become
sometimes wingy and cynical as a result
in the 14 years that she spent with
netflix alongside her
other co-conspirator reed hastings and
she really did transform hr and i know
that's what we're all super excited to
hear about
and as cheryl sandberg quoted the
the famous culture code document was
potentially the most
important document to come out of
silicon valley and
outside of that she is a now a
best-selling author
and she's a ted a ted speaker she's a
contributor to the likes of harvard
business review and
um and npr and all of these kind of
great publications but i suppose most
importantly for me
she is an incredible human being she's a
mom
a grandmother controversially has
apparently the most incredible
granddaughter in the world
and and she also is about to become a i
don't know if it's a grandmother again
is what you'd call it to a fish
who was originally called wanda but is
now well was originally called walter
but is now called wanda
uh so what i'd like to do is um i
suppose just to
welcome patty i am reliably informed she
is awake
she is caffeinated and most importantly
she has
hard pants on so good morning paddy
good morning good to see you yeah it's
great to see you i know rob mcgillifork
is somewhere in the wings
absolutely petrified of letting the two
of us free
on any kind of screens chatting to
people
yeah i think it's only fair isn't it um
um
so i suppose just i supposed to kick us
off patty when we did a quick prep run
for this
we spent about two and a half hours on
the phone and i'd say about
about two hours 30 30 minutes in we
realized we hadn't actually yet talked
about the talent summit
so for anybody who's particularly
worried about what this chat's going to
be like
it has three distinct parts the first
part where i go
oh god patty what would you do if you
were in our position
then the second part where i go right
how would you go about doing that
and then the third part which will be
the winning streak patty it's when we're
going to take the crowd with us
is when we go oh god what would you do
if somebody tried to stop you or it all
went horribly wrong
so that's kind of the very after coming
off the back of dave ulrich with all the
research that's where we're going to hit
hit into paddy so good morning um i'm
sorry i should
let you speak a bit because everybody's
here to see you not me
no um i was listening to the end to part
of david ulrich speak
too and um i got to tell you when he
said you know the most
they did all the research the most
important stuff that we do is put the
right people in the right place at the
right time amen a little weepy
you know yeah it reminded me of when
face was at facebook no google did a
five-year
research uh and they went through all
the data
on all their managers and what made them
you know project
aristotle yes yes yes all this stuff and
you know what they found out
it's like people who lead well and are
really clear communicators
yeah and tell people what they're
attempting to do in the end not what to
do every day i was like go figure it out
amazing
it's always good to have a bit of a bit
of research though to back up what you
intrinsically know
you know what was interesting about that
was laszlo bach who's the head of hr at
the time
said to me i could tell them that until
forever yeah it they only listened to
the data
right so the data was it became his
megaphone so that he could use it
so i guess you know you and i so much
time together recently i feel like let's
just get going let's start right let's
let's just get going like let's let's
start at the start right so let's
start with the proper questions and then
we can get to the fun ones at the end
and so we'll
take the box on those first but i know
joking aside so like patty i suppose
like given the backdrop everything we've
chatted about today like
if we if we took yours if we took you
back if you were hrm hrd a cpo
you're in that kind of hr
transformational role right now
how would you actually be using this as
an opportunity to transform
how people work like what would you be
doing what would you be thinking about
yeah i i was thinking one of the
questions was what would you
how would how should we start yeah and
um and i think the real question is
first stop yeah okay right this
is such a moment this i mean this year
has been so
crazy it's really really important that
we pause
and we look back on this last year
really really critically
and say boy what did we do wrong what
could we have done better
where was our timing off and then
another sort of holy what did we do that
we'd never imagined that we could do
yeah because we've had all of us have
had such
profound changes in the way we work and
how we relate to each other and yeah
you know i mean i remember early on
people saying yeah that in-person
meeting on zoom that really sucked
of course it was a fun in-person meeting
but it was terrible you know
14 people in the room only two people
talk that's email yeah
right 100 so i think that now is a
really really
important time to make sure that we set
aside enough time to reflect
and then you know and then the rest of
our talk is going to be about what to do
next
and then for me what not to do next
a hundred percent and so like when we
kind of think about that because i think
that's probably one thing that we're all
we're also action oriented so we all
like to just jump in and start doing new
stuff so first
like as you're saying stop just stop
actually just stop in general and
actually engage brain
so that's great great first starting
point um when we think about
transformation paddy and like i don't
want to
kind of spend all of this time talking
about netflix but what i'm really
curious to talk about with you is
like how you think what principles and
how you think about people so
when you're going and you're
re-engineering the world of work or
you're working with business leaders
and as we've and i'm sure we've all had
experiences that sometimes you're
working with business leaders or hr
people and
they may have very clear principles of
how they how they think about people
and other times not so clear and i
suppose maybe that's another thing for
us to say is that if you don't have
clear principles maybe
start to get some right and you don't
mean that in a smart way but like just
actually think about it
but for you if like if it was if it was
patty's principles
how would you think about people before
you even start to think about
transformation
what would be those foundations i i
really so i would say two things one of
them is
in terms of transformation we're never
done
yeah right i mean that's something that
always always always happens
and the company of tomorrow is not the
company that you work at today
and if it is then you're probably losing
right
when i coach a little startup i'll say
to them you know there's only three
endings to this story yeah you get
bigger you get smaller you get eaten
great smaller as the founder of a
startup i'm really pumped right now
not awesome but i mean but but what my
point is
yeah um smaller's death right so you're
go it's going to change you're going to
be
highly successful on your own or you're
going to be highly successful
at a part of another entity so what is
the principle that drives you to
whatever that end is
and my you know what i've what's been
really
wonderful and scary during the pandemic
is a lot of the things that i've been
saying that people say
oh that's not true that's easy for you
have turned out to be
for them so guess what everybody who
works for you as an adult
from the ceo to the person who's
cleaning the
you know the bathroom if you're still
going to work and have the best and
somebody at home is cleaning the
bathroom
so like that idea that you know
you know there's it's hierarchy we have
of sort of goodness and responsibility
the
good people the responsible people are
the ones in management and then you sort
of slow down to
well those people on the bottom we have
to treat them like children because they
really
they're not we're all adults yeah so
that's the first one right we all have
adult we're all adults
we all have fam you know we all have
other responsibilities outside of work
and now we can literally see it and
those adults aren't two separate adults
there's not the home adult and the work
adult
they're the same person and it's
interesting because like sometimes it's
super easy like i've noticed it even for
us as a startup like
you start off and you go what are our
principles around something and it's
super easy to say
we're all adults right but it's actually
so much harder
to actually make those decisions day to
day right because it's like it's really
easy to say it and put it on the website
and put on a t-shirt or whatever yeah
yeah much harder when it comes to the
crunch right right and you're in hr and
somebody comes in and says what's our
policy on some stupid thing right you're
like
i don't know what would a grown-up say
in this situation call me crazy you
can make the policy yourself by being
you know
an adult the other thing that i think
has been really clear
is that people are more responsible than
we give them credit for
you know hr has become over the last
couple decades this
weird schizophrenic i mean i i don't
know how you operate in a world where
half of your time is spent protecting
the company from those evil employees
that might sue you
and the other half of your time is spent
making sure they can get really groovy
t-shirts and hoodies and they're
gloriously happy and engaged
it's like that doesn't make any sense
so you know what we've found is that
people will work
because they enjoy it people will work
because they're
responsible people will work because you
told them to and that we
we can now judge output and not we don't
have to walk around and go yep there's
michelle she's working
meanwhile you know you're playing candy
crush right but i don't know i see
well i'm good at it but i know but i
know
what you're doing because i can see your
results now because now that's what
we're paying attention to did it get
done and we have to trust people that
say
okay signing off now get you that on
friday that they will
yeah and here's the big aha they always
could
yeah they always did right i mean this
is the part that's so heartwarming for
me it's like
people aren't behaving any different
we're learning a ton
about um the importance of in-person
feedback
in the moment feedback which is a really
big principle for me
and i believe in it because partly
because because i think
that um you know i always say if i'm
gonna stab you in the back
i gotta get a knife you gotta turn
around i gotta stab you hopefully
i'm gonna kill you i gotta get rid of
the body i mean you know all this
office politics and the subject it's
really time consuming oh yeah the thing
about
efficiency if you want your company run
really efficiently
then you're going to hire adults you're
going to assume that they're going to be
responsible you're going to assume that
they're
smart don't hire anybody who isn't right
and then
you're going to just make sure that we
stay in touch
so that you know i can't catch you in
the moment i can catch you in the moment
and go
oh my god what you're doing right now
that's it yeah
that's exactly what we talked about
right that kind of feedback
yep like you know people forget that
feedback always
also means catching somebody doing
something right yeah
and then if it's wrong i can go you know
that's not working here's
have you thought about trying it a
different way or why are you
i don't get what's up right what
i don't understand why there's conflict
here where are you coming from yeah
right
so that's another part of one of my
principles and then
i was thinking about the call before i
came on and i thought i wonder what
happens
when we go forward i'm not going to say
we go back you and i
yeah i promise you i will never say we
go back but i wonder if people aren't
going to move around more
right we've all been kind of frozen in
place yeah and one of my deep principles
is to create an organization that's a
great place to be from
yeah yeah and i want that really to sink
into people
if you thought that that was your job
to create an organization where people
were proud of what they did
yeah a great place to be from might you
think about it very differently yeah
that's it right now no so you know i
talk about i mean we'll talk about this
later when we talk about management
but you know i'd say create cv worthy
events
right create make sure that as your
teams move along and you're growing that
everything you do
that you mark it as an event that you
could put on your
own series because that's what teams
do and so i you know i just think
we're not a family no we're not in for
the fun
um we're we can see that now yeah right
we can really see that now because
you know you see people's family yeah of
course you know
i i've had a lot of conversation with
cats and that's fine with me
well in fairness that's what the
internet was created for let's just
clarify
that that's correct and now they're back
again so i
you know i've realized also that it's an
opportunity for us in hr
to be doing to see now what's moving our
businesses forward
without seeing or paying attention to
what we're
doing yes and i have in my notes you and
i taught when we talked to our two and a
half hour prep
we talked about a concept of death by a
thousand cuts
yeah and i and i think that's what we do
in hr sometimes
we ask people to do all these little did
you fill out the form did you complete
the agenda did you do your survey did
you
go you know do you uh fill out your
requisition are you in budget are you
did you get permission did you and those
tiny little
instances that people have to do
every day are what makes people crazy
yeah
it's important you know because they
interrupt your workflow and so
you know one of my deepest principles
from my organization
was to you know our most important job
was to get out of the way
yeah and so the brilliant people that we
hire can do the brilliant work we need
them to do but get
i said to my hr team one time um
yeah it's true we are a service
organization it's not spelled
s-e-r-v-a-n-d-s
yeah i love that and the people we serve
don't work here yeah
and don't try people our customers yeah
like like i think i think when you and i
talked last with rob back in march at
i don't know what event we were at we
were at something anyway and uh
and one of the things that we talked
about was the beauty forgive me for
saying the beauty of covid but one of
the good
upsides to this is that it stripped away
all the stuff so people would say to me
oh you worked at twitter you worked at
blizzard you worked all these fancy
companies but what covett has done is it
stripped it away and now it's back to
what it always is about right which is
like
the quality of the work you're doing and
the quality of the people you work with
and it doesn't matter anymore if you
work for twitter or google or beats or
whoever you work for
because you're still sitting in your
living room and it's down well
you know here's another thing that just
makes my little heart beat fast right so
when i do this when i talk to people
they're like who's doing it right and i
say
nobody finally thank
god there are no best practices amen
right i mean we just and we don't have
who cares what google's doing
yeah whatever it is they do right we
don't we don't need to do it like they
do it because
we're living in our own worlds and our
own realities with our own customers and
you're right
and we're all sitting here in our
pajamas doing work
and it is that big isn't it of news
flash like i loved the idea of when rob
said to us and i'm sure he's equal parts
terrified of putting those together but
i love that piece of like you know like
people say to me you've worked for all
these really fancy companies and i'm
like yeah and you know what
they were broken too like they might
have had amazing products and there was
a million amazing things we did but we
still had all the same challenges and
all the same crap that everyone else has
it's not like netflix was this mystical
land where
you went to the talent island and
brought it back and everything was
you know i was just thinking about where
here we go tangenting again
i was exactly thinking about that this
morning because
you know people were talking about um
the talent thing right
how do you get any players it's thinking
about a players oh yeah and i and i told
you that story i would tell people
well there's an island only i know about
and all the a players are there yeah
and what i was thinking about michelle
was in our conversation you and i were
reminiscing a little bit
about like the sucky companies we've
been at right
and what i was thinking was i was
thinking of one company in particular
that i worked at
and i and in reflection you know what
they did wrong go on
they kept me yeah and they shouldn't
have
right this was a company where my boss
said to me a little true story
she said you know patty you have a lot
of ideas and
we've had them all and they don't work
so it would be really helpful
if you would just stop having them yeah
and you know what
looking back um what i learned from that
company they were very very
administrative and they were very proud
of it
and that's what the company wanted from
this hr team yeah and
when i look back i realized they gave me
a great appreciation for people who are
really good at that
yeah you know the people that wake up in
the middle of the night and can't sleep
because they spelled somebody's name
wrong
and i'm and i'm not right but i need
those kind of people on my team
100 so you know when we start talking
about talent it's about
it's about that match right the a player
is the person who's
really good at and capable of solving
the problem that you have in front of
you
and trust me when they're doing it
that's what they're engaged yeah
it's crazy isn't it but it's not
it's not a special type of person
right you know performance is relative
to what the problem is you're trying to
solve yeah it really isn't and i know
like
one of the questions i was going to pose
you but it's not a question i'm going to
make it a statement and it's like a yes
no because otherwise we'll drag on for
ages
but like in this new world of work right
when we're on the island
do we need a new kind of people manager
yeah no maybe
yeah okay yeah we do yeah we do all
right so we need a new kind of place but
we need here no we don't know let me
stop go
we need to stop doing stupid stuff that
doesn't matter yeah
we don't need a new kind of person we're
all probably pretty good at some part of
our job
yeah right and and i think that as
people managers what we have to do is
stop
and say what is it that we do that
matters what is it that we do that move
the business forward so in order to do
that
we better damn well know what our
business is yeah
we better know how we make it we better
know what the customers are we better
know what the competitors are we better
know what they're able to do that we
can't do
and it's our i mean i love that he's
it's our job to say
are all the teams performing as well as
they could
if they're not is it because they're the
wrong people on the team
if they're not is it because people are
just tired because
they spent five years building something
and now we're asking them to maintain it
and they don't want to
yeah and they're not very good at it
right oh yeah yeah
yeah it's it's about looking at that
organization holistically
and looking about you know i always say
start with the p l
and start with your goals and objectives
and you know like
if you're installing a new uh software
system and finance and every quarter
someone says it's delayed another
quarter because it's not
you know something's gone wrong or we
can't blah blah blah you dig down in
there there's a people issue in there
100 and the it guys are going well the
finance people they're resisting the
finance people are
saying oh it's too hard right and then
you dig down and dig down and dig down
and somebody's like
no my job is data entry if we do this
new software i'm afraid i'm going to
lose it so i'll just passively
aggressively not do it
i love that and patty like that is such
a good point because it kind of was
where directionally you and i wanted to
chat about about kind of
systems thinking organizations and
systems thinking
because and when we were chatting about
it at the last day we talked about like
we used the analogy of almost the body
like and how naive and i don't even
believe people would would be saying
like
oh well you know the kidneys are more
important than the heart or the liver is
more important than the spleen because
nobody's that dumb to think that like
they're not all working in
you know synchronously like they're
everything is in service of everything
else and for some reason when we
approach organizations we think about it
in a really siloed way right so sales is
more important
ops is irrelevant oh you know and if we
think about it the exact same way as the
body
one one of the challenges i suppose are
one of the realities of hr is that
even if we don't think about if we even
if we think about our organizations as
systems
we have typically had quite a
programmatic
or a segmented approach or even if we
haven't thought about it that way and
we're like okay but it's okay
these five programs all together equal
the bigger thing
the people we work with see them in a
very systems are in a very in sorry in a
very programmatic way
what for you paddy is like the downside
to that and how would you
how would you encourage us to maybe
approach that or think about that
differently because i think that's where
directionally you were going there
the first thing i would say is pay
attention to the language we use
yeah okay and and stop talking hr speak
please please right i mean part of it is
because we say
we're about to roll out another global
hr initiative
yeah and the entire company rolls their
eyes and go whatever happened to last
year's global hr
yeah right yeah and then i
i mean people are going to be mad at me
for this but like god why do we have to
turn
everything into yeah have to pray you
know it's dni now yeah it's a dna
initiative it'll be a wellness
initiative another week it'll be a
something
yeah right dni sounds like linens and
things
right it's like so we can we can use
multi-syllabic words we can say
diversity and inclusion right
but but for what end yeah
yeah right are we doing that to write
society's wrongs that's part of it
are we doing it to make sure that we
have representation in our company of
the customers that we serve
that makes sense are we doing it because
we want to have diverse opinions and
perspectives as we're
those and then if those are the reasons
why we're doing this
then are we yeah right
did we right i mean i can't i've spent
my whole career and so have you
yeah rolling out initiatives that have
no tied to the business
no no right i'm just thinking about yeah
i think about performance improvement
plans and performance
management and you know how i hate the
annual performance review
and i was thinking about that compared
to your question about
um should we operate differently in hr
should managers operate differently now
and so if you can't tie that activity
yeah the performance of the business
what do you ask the annual performance
review what's the point
okay why do we do this oh we use it as a
mechanism
to give employees feedback on their
performance because we believe that if
we do that
that will lead to better performance
yeah okay did it
yeah i know you know
are there five that's data what's the
data on that right
yeah if we gave somebody feedback that
nine months ago they did something that
was really bad
did they stop doing it well chances are
we only told them like right
so that but but that's what we got to
what
because the hypothesis is because we
believe that giving people feedback
results in better performance
okay if we believe that to be the end
game you're going to create a system
that does it once a year yeah it's
insanity
i mean you know that's would we accept
that from finance
no you know we really those monthly
monthly
month end closes those are really a drag
so we're just going to do
quarter in close from now on but if you
think about it paddy we feel
the problem also without the system's
mentality around
when we just implement things as
projects programs
policies whatever they are in the in
their in their smaller elements is that
we don't think about where it all fits
together right so like if we think like
on one hand and
i i would hear this often and i'm sure
you're the same as a hr director or cpo
or whatever is that
you know i would be like but feedback is
just feedback but that
in theory it is right but in practice it
isn't because the reality is is that if
you give me crappy feedback
and i suddenly go from a five to a three
on my performance rating
then my money's affected my you know
then somebody gives me puts that
stupid curve you know that bell curve
like the absolutely no logic yeah
oh god and so then someone puts the bell
curve and then suddenly i'm being
managed out or i can't get my per b i
can't get my
my my next promotion or so the reality
is is that
we've put systems around things that
actually work in
in like in total oppositional to to what
you're trying to achieve
so feedback can never be feedback
not only that it's not transparent
oh god no let's take compensate
compensation is a great example oh yeah
right
you and i know what a bell curve
distribution is you and i know what
uh uh percent percentile
right i remember coaching a startup in
the hr person says yes we've decided to
mark our salaries
in the 60th percentile oh okay can i be
an employee
um who gets the other 40 percent yeah
that's what percentile means i'm like i
know that and you know that
and nobody on earth knows when i talk to
women's groups this is my favorite thing
to say to them i'm like okay here's the
deal
when they talk about engagement they
don't put a ring on it yeah
you're not married to them right and if
you go interview with somebody else
you know you're not cheating on your
husband you're finding out what you're
worth
and by the way if you're worth 20
more than you're getting paid yeah right
and you go into a company with six and a
half percent merit increase budget and a
bell curve distribution
and you are amazing yeah
and they say to you your hr person and
your hiring manager goes
you know what you're so good yeah we
gave you 14
yeah don't tell anybody because six and
a half percent is the
you know the average but don't but
that's because you're four and you're
you're supposed to feel really good
that you suck by six percent
compounded and i tell them i'm like if
it's money you want
and that's the way your compensation
system works you will never catch up
no no right so so to hr people
shall i say the way to fix that problem
is to write some checks yeah if that's a
problem in your language
and then step back and say as the way
we've done compensation
really reflected in the real world so
this is a great example
of of something that we can think about
right now in the past
yeah right when we go back wait a minute
wait a minute wait a minute our
our nine bucks matrix of performance
factors
yeah system that we've been rolling out
globally for the you know as an
initiative for the last few years
did we get it wrong you know did it
turn out that that quiet person who
just was heads down and never really
needed that much attention
is getting so much work now yeah yeah
done now right because because they're a
person
that really excels and i don't need a
lot of direction i actually just
let me know where we're going i'll do
the work and get it done so
like that's the thing
who thinks we don't stop and say did it
work why didn't why did we do it
and then if we do it for that reason is
that reason
being fulfilled is it working yeah and
most importantly i mean if nothing else
my clarion message
is if it doesn't then stop doing it just
throw it away yeah
and that kind of leads me on paddy like
because i'm i'm just kind of conscious
of our time as well it's like
i think that one of the things that
sometimes you hear a lot particularly
like i know in both of our careers we've
come into
i suppose people will say well to fix
things right and so sometimes the thing
you hear a lot is somebody says is yeah
well i'd love to change i don't know x
or y
but i can't because right like and
i'm not saying that in every case that
there's not a validity to what their
you know part of the argument is or
whatever but how would you kind of
encourage us to think about that so if
for someone that's sitting at home and
saying i am so on with what patty's
saying right our comp structure or our
feedback structure or our whatever
is not what i wanted to be um but i
can't because
how would you say right how do we think
about that patty like how
what should we be supposed how could we
make that possible
you know i bet you that a lot of people
that say i can't because yeah
said oh no working from home will never
work for us
you know i can't because it's really
important that we be in the office for
meetings we can
we'd like to be able to accommodate that
for you but we can't because
yeah and um we did this in 48 hours
right yeah so every single person on
this call
has done something they said they
couldn't do yeah in the last year
every single one of us and you know what
that muscle was there all along
but what i want you to do right now
every single one of you is pat yourself
on the back
and say to yourself wow yeah i just did
something really innovative and really
creative
for a whole lot of people in a very
short period of time
now did was it perfect from the
beginning no right
did i know what how to do it best then
no
right did you take the chance yes did
you have any other alternatives
no right so first of all i want us to go
we already did something we didn't think
we could do
yeah it's totally fine i want you to i
want that in your
reptile brains right so that the next
time
you say to yourself we can't because
say to yourself wait a minute i already
did
right and the other one is the camp
because
we we're not as good as we could be
at saying we can because here's the
results that we think will be different
yeah here's how we're going to measure
it right the other thing
you know that's not in our lingo that's
very personal to me
was i you know i was surrounded by
people who were inventing things
all of the time yeah and i just paid a
lot of attention to how they did it and
how they did it was they said
what's the end game yeah right what
would be the optimal
customer experience let's go there they
don't say
i wonder what everybody else is doing
you know what we can make watching
television
a little bit better than able
right no it was like let's go let's go
way out there
and so we have to start looking at the
work that we do in the same way
yeah and here's another thing i learned
from them when you do that so
many of the things i did at netflix many
many many of them
i said to the employees well every other
hr person that i've talked to on the
planet thinks it's the stupidest idea i
ever had
the lawyers say that if this is like
when we get rid of paid time off the
lawyers say
that either uh myhr friends say either
nobody will come to work or
uh everybody will work all the time no
it didn't come off and the lawyers say
people are going to take time off in
different ways and you're going to be
just
awash in lawsuits right so i said to the
folks i'm like
i don't think so because i don't keep
track of it now and work seems to be
getting done
so um let's try for six months this
crazy idea of just not bothering with
keeping track of it yeah
yeah right and if it turns out that
they're right and i'm wrong then we'll
just go back and do what everybody else
doesn't call it
right yeah but that that's that's kind
of the conundrum
i didn't roll it out as a global hr
initiative i said
you guys with me on an experiment for
six months yeah
but but paddy don't you think that's
kind of the conundrum that i i mean we
i think we both have experienced a lot
in organizations which is like
so we talk to the employees and we tell
everybody how they need to have this
growth mindset and
we'll bring in speakers and we look at
all this great stuff and that's fabulous
right
but actually we don't live the growth
mindset like i think raj talked about it
earlier um when he was on talking about
remote working
and he was saying like whatever's
modeled by the c-suite will be what will
happen that or whatever is modeled by
the leadership that will determine the
level
and and i think that's like a lot of
isn't it what we do we we are so
obsessed with the the micro of things
right so like we've talked you and i
have talked about this so many times
like so
we spend all this time trying to woo a
candidate and the first thing we hit
them with is a giant big legal document
that tells them all the ways we can fire
them
and it's like it's those contradictions
right like
so we're all the time managing to the
lowest common denominator
um instead of addressing that and i mean
you know i think most of my friends know
all of my store my random stories like
but
you know like remember and and i
obviously won't name names but
i worked for a company with a had a bird
for a logo and there was an incident
once with a beer fridge
and you know and the immediate reaction
with most of us as senior leaders was
like okay we'll need to get together
what
you know and everybody's going around
the room what are we going to do about
it and one was like we should remove the
fridge right because of course
take it away and the next one was like
well we should have a policy on it
and then and i'm sitting there and i'm
like oh god please i don't want to have
to be the one that says this but
you know eventually when they came
around to me and somebody said you're
kind of quiet and you're not normally
and i was like well i'm
trying to be a good leader which is
really hard for me terrible listener
and i remember it came to me and i said
well you know i don't know about you
guys but i know who was here when i left
last night at ten o'clock
so i know the people that were there and
hey you know i know some of them because
some of them are on my team and how
about we just do a radical thing and
like actually talk to them
and you know like and but and the reason
i say that and it might sound trivial
but for me that was such an important
and a defining moment because it was
that bit about
it's it's where we started this
conversation right it's the rubber
hitting the road it's that bit about
saying
we're going to treat people like adults
but it is so so easy to revert to type
to revert to what we know to revert to
what we're comfortable with
and also what our people are comfortable
with right because
that's that's it's the push and the pull
on both sides you know
sorry well and i think that you know
it's
it may be harder but not really
to think about i mean now is such a good
time to think about what really engages
people
right it's a really important time and
my experience is you know you're the
beer fridge is such a good
example of that particular space and
time right
yeah i mean i'm not talking to companies
who have employees overwhelmingly
complaining that
they don't have a beer fridge because
they have all have
their own fridges and some have beer in
them
and all of that effort and time we spent
making them happy and engaged at work
you know
yeah yeah it didn't did it matter it
didn't really matter
right and so i found in all of my many
many many years
that the happy and engaged employees are
doing work they love
with teammates that are really good and
they're accomplishing
incredible stuff i mean i used to tell
the people who
who did that happy hr work say go ask
five people in your organization that
are very well respected
yeah tell them tell me about something
that a day that there's something you
were really proud about
yeah and every single one of those
stories will be about something hard
yeah of course
because it's right and it's that we did
it thing and so
i think it's hr people that's where we
open our eyes and look yeah right now we
look around and go
who pulled off something during all this
that wasn't the team i would have
expected
yeah yeah right who who who
actually kind of stumbled and were stars
in the office
right was what happened here what did we
learn
from this very forced situation yeah i
mean and you know this too
for me you know it was always hard
we talked earlier about change right the
the massive organizational changes were
what
always exposed our strengths and
weaknesses
right and the thing is that every time
you hit another one of those steps
it's a new set of strengths and
weaknesses so
you know now it's about saying huh
was all that stuff that we were all
leading up to before this happened
useful
and going forward and it's more
important so i i don't want to go back i
don't want us to go back if
we all end up back in the office doing
the things like we always do
don't talk to me anymore i'm done
but this is our time right this is our
time to say
let's go forward and create the
organizations that we want to work in
can i ask you one last question before
we finish up and i'm conscious the time
because i know rob will be around
somewhere where the sheep's
trying to get me he just wants to get
upstage yeah i know he does
but one question that i think like if i
were
the average hr person who does have
vision and who has passion around this
stuff
but is hitting maybe a point where maybe
they can't bring the c-suite on the
journey you know or they're start
they're struggling to write because that
is the reality
um or you know they're trying to
influence people like i remember a phone
call you and i had a couple of years ago
where i was like i just can't get them
on board and you went maybe you should
just leave
because they're not going to get it so i
guess there's a part of me in the back
of my mind going like
how would paddy mccord approach it if
you were if you were someone who was
there you're
kind of pragmatically minded kind of
going let's move this thing forward but
you're struggling
or not struggling but you need to bring
that c-suite or your senior leaders on
on a journey with you what would what
would you be doing how would you be
thinking about how would you be
approaching a paddy
i have a i have something i call my
algorithm for success
i worked with all those geeks all those
years they liked it that i said
algorithm
okay so but mine has words not numbers
and it goes like this
is what you love to do that you're
extraordinarily good at doing
something we need someone to be great at
yeah
right yeah it's what you love to do that
you are extraordinarily good at doing
something we need someone to be great at
and oh by the way
if that is your passion and your
personal journey
and you really want an opportunity to do
it and you've got to
convince 11 people who don't think it's
important and don't want to do it and
think your idea is kind of dumb
yeah then your chances are not very
great yeah
right okay and so that's thing one thing
two
is not everything has to be a global
rollout
yeah right so one of the things i also
learned from innovators
is they pick a small group and test yeah
right so there's no reason why you
everything doesn't have to be the same
consistency is a really bad
you know when people like oh we do it
because we want people to be consistent
i'm like
that's it that's our bar the same like
this pretty low bar yes
everybody does the same stupid stuff but
we do it the same all over the world
i love this great quote so maybe
experiment with a small team of people
with an objective in mind the other
thing is you must
describe the things that you want to do
using the words of the business
but i'm assuming you're going to say to
me that's not jargon though
that's using meaningful simple words
that the business uses
actual words that people actually use
in life okay not like high performance
okay fine stop it right just stop it
we use the language that nobody else
understands yeah
yeah it's just crazy so
and oh by the way if there's sometimes
when you
you know i i would take hr people and
try and deprogram them i'm like
uh-huh tell me that as if i was your
grandma
yeah or a four-year-old right use just
regular words and you'll find that it
comes across much quicker
yeah yeah so you know there's
it is it is a pencil um sometimes you
find an advocate in your it but if you
find an advocate in your company that
says i'm willing to do some
experimenting with you
yeah then you have to decide beforehand
what the results are going to be
because that's every other department in
the company has to speak to results
and there's no reason you shouldn't be
able to yeah yeah
and i think you and i chatted about it
the last day when we were talking about
um norman was talking to me about like
this idea of the design mindset so that
you don't start you you start out with
like a directional
here's what i'm looking to achieve but
you don't try to get there
on like step one so this is this idea of
you start with a load of ideas almost
like in a funnel and then you just start
to reduce down
and you're not afraid to iterate and and
kind of
and and and i suppose take that feedback
and move whereas
a lot of the time we tend to be like
we're going to implement this or do this
and we go straight from here to here
and there's just no logic to it is there
but it's it's almost how we're well you
know
a great a great example of that is the
netflix culture deck that you quoted you
know this yeah
yeah quote right guess how long it took
us to write that
oh god go on okay fair enough
[Laughter]
years yeah and then reid re-wrote it
in the company and then he just
published a book and probably ten years
from now they'll be a different one yeah
and it was an iterative process that's
never done
yeah right and i think one of them but
but so i think you're right there's two
things you said that are really
important one of them is
it you know experiment iterate
experiment iterate experiment but know
what it is that you have
at the end of mind yeah and the second
thing is when you
um have some of those milestones that
you know you want to achieve to get
there
then don't put don't say someday yeah
yeah right if you say someday i think
you mean next thursday but the person
next to me says
oh god she's been saying someday for six
years yeah
god knows when that's gonna happen right
no so i mean that's that
the other thing that we could get better
at as a discipline is wrapping time
around what we do yeah
yeah right beginning you're right begin
with the end of the mind yeah and what
the results are going to be
and what's going to be different work
back to where we are and then stop
occasionally and say did we and probably
patty moore that mvp mindset right that
minimal viable product that we would
is so prevalent in the engineering world
right what is the the least amount that
we can get out to get feedback on to
then figure is this a good idea or not
do we build deeper into it or not and
and most importantly because i know
we're coming to the end
most importantly do not put something on
top of something that doesn't work
yeah right we we we think we're tweaking
but we're not we're like
yeah we still want to do how we used to
do but we wanted we have this new like
we're gonna make it on your phone we're
going to make this really bad process
mobile well who doesn't want that in
fairness i don't know
what sounds winning to me or we won't
make it mobile right and you have to
fill out five pieces of paper
you know somebody in the mobile team has
to fill out all these forms
to get money to develop a mobile product
that's the you know it's okay
yeah to say that's not working we're not
going to do that anymore
so it's funny just to kind of wrap us up
because i know we're just a time now and
rob is probably in total disbelief that
we're actually on time with 39 seconds
to go
he's like literally probably having a
heart attack but i think what's really
interesting about
that patty is this idea of like we've
talked about humanizing the workplace
but actually what i've taken a lot from
the conversation with you is actually
humanizing hr but not externally but
actually for ourselves
like actually how do we think about it
can we treat ourselves like humans
work in a human way think about humans
because if we can do that bit we can get
the next bit right which is transform
the organizations and help the humans in
them so
paddy with that and just to say as
always it's been a pleasure
i'm particularly impressed that we
haven't used one cuss word between us
and we've managed 45 minutes
yeah i'll call you later though but
thank you so much for your time and have
a good rest today
all right cheers patty take to all of
[Music]
[Applause]

Creating High Performance Culture | Patty McCord | Talks at Google
[MUSIC PLAYING]
SPEAKER 1: Good morning.
Good morning.
Thank you all so
much for coming.
Today at Google, we're delighted
to welcome Patty McCord.
Patty is one of the
world's foremost experts
on company culture.
She was an early
employee at Netflix,
and she was a co-author of
the famous Netflix culture
deck, which Sheryl
Sandberg said was
one of the most
important documents
to come out of Silicon Valley.
She's here today to discuss
her new book, titled "Powerful:
Building a Culture of Freedom
and Responsibility," which
was largely an effort
to sort of boil down
the message of the famous
Netflix culture deck.
So please join me in welcoming
to Google Miss Patty McCord.
[APPLAUSE]
PATTY MCCORD: So I'm
just going to couple--
how many people have seen
the Netflix culture deck?
A couple of you.
I didn't write it.
I didn't co-author it with Reed
Hastings, the CEO of Netflix.
Reed and I did another
company before Netflix,
a company called Pure Software.
We sold software tools to
other software engineers.
And we grew through a
merger and acquisition.
And how we grew was
we'd acquire a company,
and every time we'd acquire
a company, we'd double.
So we were like
100, 200, 400, 6--
right.
And then we sold the company
to our largest competitor.
And my job was to
take their employee
handbook and our
employee handbook
and smash them
together and come up
with the fewest policies
that would piss off
the fewest people.
And so what we decided to do
at Netflix that was different
was pay attention to
the kind of company
that we were working
at, primarily
for totally selfish reasons.
I didn't want to work with
brilliant assholes anymore.
And I wanted to have
permission to say no.
And Reed wasn't very tolerant
of people who weren't very smart
or weren't very
into the company.
So what we decided
to do differently,
for those of you that have
read the Netflix culture deck,
is just write stuff down.
So my journey was not only to
write down what kind of company
that we wanted to
work at, my job was
to be the COO of that culture,
which meant if we said this,
then did we do this?
And that's the part where
most companies get it wrong.
And I want you to
go away from my talk
today and think about
what you're doing here
and what you're saying
you are as Google
and who you really
are acting as Google,
because that's what
company culture really is.
So since I've been away,
I get to talk to people
who are outside of
business and who
are people who are kind
of on the speaker circuit.
So I end up onstage
with a lot of coaches,
like real sports coaches from
real professional sports teams.
So I was in Montreal
last year in February.
Has anybody been to
Montreal in February?
So cold.
It is so cold.
So I called up my daughter,
and I said, hey, by the way,
I'm doing this talk in
Montreal in February.
She's like, Mom,
go to Patagonia.
Go now.
Get a puffy coat.
Get the big one.
So then I realized how dang cold
it is in Montreal in February.
So I figure out
my hotel so that I
can go underground so that I
can go up to the venue, which is
a place called the Bell Centre.
Does anybody know what happens
at the Bell Centre in Montreal?
No hockey fans, huh?
OK.
Well, that's where the
Stanley Cup is played.
Now, at this point
I've been talking
to groups who are a little
bigger than you, but not much.
Like as if this room was full
is kind of my biggest audience.
So I go down below.
And at the last minute, they
said to me, oh, by the way,
you're not going to
be onstage alone.
You're going to be with this
guy named Scotty Bowman.
So I google Scotty Bowman,
and he's a hockey coach.
He's the winningest
hockey coach in history
in the National Hockey League.
So I meet him underground.
We're underground at this venue.
And he's this older gentleman.
He's like 70, and he has on a
little suit with a maple leaf
pin and an American flag.
And we're talking
about his grandkids.
And he says to me,
we're under the ice.
And then it occurs to me,
we're in a hockey stadium.
Like a hockey stadium.
So it's not you guys.
It's not this little
intimate room.
I go up onstage, and my
face is on the Jumbotron.
I mean, it's like huhhh!
And it's really scary.
And there's thousands of
people in the audience.
And so he introduces
me, nice introduction.
The audience claps
very politely,
and I go sit on my
little velvet couch.
And Scott Bowman comes up,
and the place goes crazy.
I'm in Montreal in
a hockey stadium
with the winningest
hockey coach in history.
They're clapping like this.
[LAUGHTER]
If they had had
those foam fingers,
they'd be doing
the foam fingers.
I mean, people are
like, taking selfies.
Because I'm onstage
with God, as far as
they're concerned in Montreal.
So he comes up.
He sits down.
The master of ceremonies,
who has a diamond
earring and teleprompter, and
he's working the audience.
And he says, Mr. Bowman,
you're such a legend.
You've won so many tournaments.
You've played with
all the great players.
What does it take to
be a winning team?
How do you give people feedback?
And he says, well, we
have an 80-game season.
And every 10 games, I sit
down with each player,
and I do an assessment
of how they're doing.
They do a self-assessment.
We pull all the stats.
We get feedback from
the other coaches.
We get feedback from
the other players.
We talk about who we're going to
play in the next 10 games, what
the competition is, where their
strengths and weaknesses are.
And we put together
a plan that we're
going to execute for
the next 10 games
so that that person can be
an incredibly high performer.
So the guy says to
me, Patty McCord,
you've been known for
saying how much you hate
the annual performance review.
And I do.
I think it's an utter,
total waste of time for most
companies that do it that way.
And so he said, if you
didn't do that, what would
you do instead?
And I said, what he said.
Because the thing is
that sports coaches
know how to put
together teams that win.
And that's really all
that management really
is, as far as I'm concerned.
For 30 years, I've been watching
people put together teams.
And it's all about doing that.
And the reason I also put
the slide up that says team
is that-- and I
know you probably
don't say this much
here, but in case you
do-- you're not a family.
Right?
Work isn't your family.
It's not undying love.
You're not going to loan your
deadbeat brother-in-law money,
and he'll never pay you
back, because you always do.
Because this is work.
And you come together
to do something
that you can only do here.
And that's create
terrific products
that make people happy.
And that joy, I
think, of working
is what really
makes people happy.
And I say that here
at Google, where you
have God's gift to everything.
And I know that when you go
home and you say, oh my God, it
was an amazing day at
work, almost always
when you say that
truthfully from your soul,
it's because you
did something hard
with really smart people that
made you really effective.
And that's my observations of
teams over all those years.
And in order to
make it work, it's
about putting together
the right teams.
So because I started
as a recruiter,
I think a lot about talent.
And what I want to
talk to you about
is you today, because
I think I don't
need to lecture you guys about
how great organizations should
move fluidly and
be more flexible
and be more accepting of
change, because that's
the world that you live in.
But I want to talk to you
about how you navigate
through your own career.
So I just did a talk
with 1,500 HR people.
I know that's a frightening
idea for most of you.
It's even a frightening
idea for me.
Like when I first started
talking to HR people
before I wrote the
book, people walked out
because I said things
that really upset them.
But what I said was
to 1,500 HR people,
please raise your hand
if you're in the job
that you had when you
graduated from college.
How many people
raised their hand?
None.
How many of you have
ever done a layoff?
1,500 people raised their hands.
How many of you have ever
laid off a family member?
There's always one.
Don't ask me why,
but people do that.
Like somebody did.
And then I say, how many of
you have said the word family
at work?
And 900 people
raised their hands.
And I say, for all of you
that aren't in the same job,
you mean none of you could
work for a company that
could handle retention?
So the truth is that
our lives, our careers,
are full of lots
of different jobs
in lots of different
organizations.
And what I love about
Google these days
is that you've now
admitted that there's
lots of different organizations
in the corporation that
is Google, all the
alphabet companies.
So if you start thinking
about your career
and how you're going
to be successful
and how you're going
to move forward,
here's my hint from doing this
for a very, very long time.
Is what you love to do that
you are extraordinarily
good at doing something the
company you work for needs
someone to be great at?
So if you wake up in
the morning and you
don't want to come to work,
or you're not looking forward
to it and it seems
really horrible,
then something's wrong
with Patty's algorithm.
And I say algorithm because I
worked with geeks all my life,
and I love you and I miss you.
But if I say words like
algorithm, it helps, right?
OK.
So what you love
to do that you're
extraordinarily good at doing--
is it important?
So when you find yourself
coming to work and thinking,
they just don't care about
how good I am at writing.
They don't even
realize how wonderful
I am, how talented I am.
They may realize
it and not care.
That's the honest truth.
And the other part is
if you need somebody
to be really, really
good and really, really
passionate about a problem
you're trying to solve,
and they can just do it,
but they don't love it,
then you're not happy on
the other side either.
So the reason why
I'm telling you this
is it's your job
to navigate this.
It's not somebody else's
job to suddenly realize
that you are unhappy.
Trust me, they know.
And it's not somebody
else's job to realize
that you went home thinking
this was the best working
day of your life.
It's yours.
So as you go through
your work life,
I want you to be really
cognizant of what
you're learning, what you're
liking, what you're not liking.
Half of what we
learn in our careers
is the work that
we do that we hate.
I remember driving
away from a job
once, looking in
the rear-view mirror
like, if I never see that
place again as long as I live.
And then I tried to pin it down.
What was it about that
place that made me crazy?
And it was a company that
had thousands and thousands
of employees, and they
talked to them as head count.
They didn't have names.
They were just head count to
be grown or shrunk or grown
or shrunk.
So that's the part about talent.
Your talent is really
important to wherever you work.
And you want to make sure
that you're in a place that
recognizes that.
And then the last thing I
wanted to talk to you about--
and since we're such
an intimate audience,
it'd be really fun if
you could talk to me.
The last thing I
wanted to talk to you
about is the idea
of transformation.
So I spend a whole bunch of
time with really big companies
who invite me in to
talk about how they're
going to transform into
an agile tech company
like we have here in the valley.
And they have no clue.
So they can't do
it, but you can.
And so the way to
create the workplace
that you want to have is to be
vocal about it and to speak up.
And for us to start
talking to each other
really honestly about what
works and what doesn't work.
And I think that you can
have incredible conversations
about work.
You know this story I told
you about Scott Bowman
at the beginning of my talk?
A couple of days ago,
a couple of weeks
ago, I was at this
thing in Texas.
And the coach of the
San Antonio Spurs--
it's a professional
basketball team-- was on.
And it was a very
touchy-feely audience.
And somebody said, oh, my
question for you, Coach,
is it must be really horrible
when you have to cut people
from the team after you've put
all that energy into recruiting
them and having them
play a whole season
and they've done their best.
And doesn't that feel terrible?
And he said, no.
Actually it doesn't at all.
Like, it's professional
basketball.
You didn't sign up for
a lifetime appointment.
Everybody understands that.
And I was in the
audience thinking,
why can't we just have
those conversations?
Why can't we have those
conversations with each other?
We hired you to do this
thing, and you were amazing.
Thank you.
We're done.
That part's over.
So now what are you
going to do next?
And what I think
about when I think
about Scotty's methodology
for giving people feedback,
it's called a performance
improvement plan.
Too bad we ruined that word.
Like what if we actually
got together and said,
let's put together a plan so
that we can perform better?
What a concept.
But that's not what
we normally do.
And so that's why I think
real transformation comes
from two things.
One of them is to stop speaking
a language about management
that no one understands and just
be able to start telling people
the truth.
I just don't love you anymore.
I don't need you.
Or maybe you need
something that's
more interesting and
stimulating over here.
Or maybe you should move on.
Or maybe you can
say, hey, look, I'm
looking at a lot of
other opportunities,
and I want to think about
what that means for me.
That you can really have
those honest conversations.
And the second part is that you
can tell the truth about what
you want and what you need.
And your managers can tell you
the truth about the future.
And you can navigate your own
careers through all of that
and not wait for somebody
else to take care of you.
When I talk to women's
groups, I say, look,
employee engagement does not
mean somebody put a ring on it.
And interviewing
with another company
to find out what you're worth--
which is what you're
worth, by the way.
And if you feel like
you're underpaid
and you're waiting for
somebody to notice,
that is not going to happen.
Go find out what
you're worth, and that
happens with interviewing.
Interviews get
you opportunities.
Interviews get you jobs.
You should be doing that
for the rest of your life.
So when you find
yourself waiting
for someone in management
to take care of you,
I want you to remember my words
and go take care of yourself,
OK?
That's my talk for today.
Do you guys want to talk to me?
Let's do some Q&A. Yeah.
AUDIENCE: Do we have mikes or--
PATTY MCCORD: Do you have--
do we need mikes?
Yeah, in case we
put it in the video.
The last slide is my book, which
there are some you get to have.
AUDIENCE: So if you have an
organization, particularly one
like Netflix that had a
reputation for this, where
a certain number
of low performers,
you're going to churn
them out each year,
how do you decide
where that bar is?
Do you target a certain
percentage of the organization
or absolute performance bar?
PATTY MCCORD: No, it was
never like that at all, ever.
Ever.
So here's how it
typically happened.
I'll give you a story that--
anybody here use DVD by mail?
OK.
So we had grown.
This is when we were
transitioning to streaming,
when we were transitioning out
of the DVD by mail business
into the streaming business.
And we had had an incredible
run that particular year.
I don't remember
which year it was.
But we'd grown 30%
quarter over quarter
for three quarters in a row.
So we're at our
executive staff meeting.
And Reed wants to go
to the white board
and do disaster planning,
because he loves it.
Like, what if it goes
to shit in a handbasket?
That's his favorite thing to do.
So I say, hey, for sport,
what if it kept up?
What if we kept growing
quarter over quarter,
30% quarter over quarter
compounded for the next three
quarters?
CFO goes to the white board.
He's doing top line revenue.
And he's doing that happy
dance, like, look at the money.
Look at the money,
look at the money!
Ted Sarandos, who's our head
of content, says-- at the time,
we said wistfully, someday
we'll be as big as HBO.
And he says, shit, you guys.
That's next year.
It's possible that we'll
be as big as HBO next year.
And we all just
looked at each other.
And Neil, who was our head
of product at the time,
said, that's a third of
the US internet bandwidth.
[LAUGHTER]
AUDIENCE: The ISPs
have noticed that too.
PATTY MCCORD: And I'm
looking at him like, what?
So afterwards, he and I
are sitting there like,
does anybody know
how to do that?
'Cause files, video
files were so big.
You guys remember.
You were around at that time.
I'm like, how do we do-- like,
we had a data center because we
shipped DVDs by mail.
So we're brainstorming,
like, is it Google?
Is it Yahoo?
Is it eBay?
Who's moving that
much data that has--
and it's got to be in
the cloud, clearly.
We're not going to do
this in a data center.
So we sit down with our IT
guys, and they're brilliant.
These are brilliant,
wonderful, amazing people.
And we say, here's
the problem set.
And they say, no worries.
You guys go exec something.
We'll build the cloud.
And I looked at them
and said, you know what?
If anybody on earth
could do this, it's you.
Not in nine months.
We couldn't do that.
It was just the time frame
was too short for these people
to be those experts to be able
to accomplish the business
objective.
And we're certainly not
going to miss our window,
if it's there, because we
don't have the right IT team.
So I said to them, that's
not going to happen.
But we've got nine
months to figure it out.
And so we turned, that
year, 97% of that team.
And most of them went on to
a company called Chegg, which
is a Netflix for textbooks.
So they went, and they took
their physical shipping
and receiving database
skills to do that.
So that was typically
what happened.
Typically what happened was
we'd either build something
and it'd be done--
and when I used to interview
Google people, people
who had an offer with you
guys and an offer with us,
I would say, look, two
different problem sets.
Organizing the
world's information
is a big problem set.
We're delivering
movies and TV shows
to people's homes
or their devices.
That's it.
One problem.
That's all we do.
So that's typically
what happened.
So the DVD by mail
business still exists.
I don't know if
you guys know that.
I still use it on my boat.
AUDIENCE: You still use it?
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah.
And it has a great catalog
because it has everything
known to humankind
because you don't
have to buy rights for it.
But that business is probably--
I bet there's not 100 people
in that business anymore.
So that's more what happens.
I know reputationally what
Netflix has a reputation for,
but we never said--
why would we do that?
If we said in chapter 2, we're
a high-performance culture,
you don't have to cut the
bottom third performers
because you don't have them.
And my experience is this.
If you hire somebody
who can't do the job,
they are completely
without fault. That's
in the interview process.
That person, that
candidate has no--
there's nothing they did wrong.
You hired the wrong person.
If you hire somebody and they're
close but no cigar, right?
It's like, I love you.
I love you, man.
I love you.
Not really sure.
You can still do that,
but you should be honest.
Should be able to say
to you, you know what?
You're not exactly the skill
set we were looking for,
but we love you.
And we're willing to take
the chance if you are.
And then if it doesn't work
out, then it doesn't work out.
Everybody tried.
So that's what I'm saying.
You can start being
honest in an interview.
So that's more
typically what happens.
My experience is you
either join a company
that you think you're
intellectually going to like,
and you don't when
you really get there.
Netflix was not a
particularly good place
for people who liked structure
or liked just R&D work,
because it was so
about deliverables.
AUDIENCE: Thanks.
PATTY MCCORD: Sure.
Right in front of you.
AUDIENCE: Hey.
PATTY MCCORD: Hi.
AUDIENCE: I was wondering.
You have the idea of
this generous severance
package and the idea that
you let go of people easily.
Did you have to change
the company culture
to get to the point where
that became acceptable,
or was that--
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah.
It took-- if you go back and
read the Netflix culture deck,
we wrote each chapter after
the chapter before it.
So when we said, we're going to
have a high-performance culture
of adults, and then we're going
to give them a lot of freedom,
it probably took
four years for me
to figure out how to do that.
So I had to figure out
the severance package.
So let's say that,
in a typical company,
let's say we've hired
you to do something.
You've been here for years.
You're amazing.
You've done it.
The DVD by mail guys, right?
Don't need you anymore.
Now I'm going to put you on
a performance improvement
plan for three months to
prove you're incompetent.
But we both know you're not.
Well, that's just mean.
So instead, I would
say, you know what?
We've been talking about this.
Can't wait to see
where you go next.
I mean, half of my
Netflix alumni are here.
So I can't wait to
see where you go next.
Here's three months' pay.
Let's just not go
through this crazy stuff.
There's just no
reason to do that.
So that's how I thought
about the severance packages,
was if I did the thing
that people normally do
and instead just said,
how much is that worth?
Then I'd just paid you that.
I also had to have an
incredible recruiting
team that would hire
the people for the jobs
that we needed getting
done in the future.
So that took me a long time, to
have a really, really top-notch
recruiting team.
I had to think about
competitive offers.
I had to think about head-count
dollars in terms of dollars,
not in terms of
number of people.
So in most companies--
I don't know how it
works here-- but there's
three ways you get a requisition
approved if you want to hire
somebody in most companies.
You write a job description
that either describes
the person who left that
you wish hadn't, a fantasy
person that doesn't
exist, or whatever
it takes to get it approved.
None of those have anything
to do with actually hiring
somebody to solve the problem.
And the truth is that when
you find somebody who's
really qualified to
solve the problem,
you should pay whatever
it takes to get them.
But in some organizations,
especially when
I'm with startups, when they
get to step functional scale
and I say, that new
team is not this team.
You're not going to make
them into that, particularly
on problems of
complexity and scale.
So that's how I
thought about it.
I thought about it in
terms of the whole thing.
How do we have not
just high performers,
but high performers in each
job to solve each problem?
That's the difference.
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
kind of personnel development
in that kind of world?
PATTY MCCORD: Yeah,
but not so formally.
My experience is the
best way to develop
is to be around
amazing people who
you learn from all the time.
So I did a lot of
matching with people,
putting people with
other people that they
could learn a lot from.
And making-- we had
a lot of systems
in place to share mostly
business information.
So a lot of our communication
and education in the company
was around the business,
not necessarily
around those skills.
I think you learn best
when you can see it.
When you see somebody
behaving like a great manager,
then you have a
great role model.
AUDIENCE: Patty,
compensation teams
love the annual
performance review
because it makes
annual increases,
equity modeling, super simple,
perhaps even algorithmic.
When you throw that
out in favor of lots
of feedback and conversations,
how do you connect the dots?
PATTY MCCORD: I don't
have any problem
with an annual
compensation review.
I think it's really smart.
Actually, I recommend
that you do them quarterly
and walk through the
company quarterly.
The most important way to
think about compensation
is market-based pay.
And the most real compensation
information in your company
is in your recruitment team,
not in last year's survey.
That's what is really happening.
You want to know what's
really happening.
That's my problem with most
standard compensation teams,
is they operate on systems and
with data that's really old.
And I don't know if you guys do.
I know that you guys are
more analytic than that.
But so I would usually walk
through the organization
and say, where have I
hired a lot of people?
Because where I've
hired a lot of people,
that's going to give me really
current salary information.
That's going to color how I pay
the people that are currently
there that you want to stay.
So I don't have any
problems at all with it.
The problems I have
are when we take
the review and the
compensation and the feedback,
and we throw them all
together once a year.
And we say it solves
those problems.
So I was going to
tell you earlier,
the most innovative
work I did at Netflix
was not anything new.
It was just I stopped
doing old things that
don't matter anymore.
So that story I told
you about Scotty Bowman
is a story about
giving great feedback.
And if you're going to
give people great feedback,
that's going to affect
their performance.
You're not going to
do it once a year.
Name one other thing you do
once a year that you're good at.
That would be nothing.
So great feedback--
so if you want
to create a system that
says, I believe that feedback
can improve performance.
I want to create a
system that does that.
Then who would ever come up with
the annual performance review?
It's a dumb system to do that.
If you say, I want to have an
annual compensation review,
where I do a point-in-time
look across the organization
and see is pay
working out fairly
and equitably for people,
and is it market-based?
Am I paying competitively?
Then that's a completely
reasonable exercise to do.
There's where I have the
problem, is we mush it together
and we're not clear.
The other problem I have with
a lot of compensation systems
is they're not
transparent to employees.
It's magic that happens in HR.
And even some HR people
don't know how it works.
The recruiting team doesn't
know how the comp team works.
It's just crazy stuff.
So again, it's about--
like, I got rid of the--
when I was at Netflix, I
got rid of paid time off--
keeping track of paid time off.
I got rid of travel policies.
And I got-- actually I didn't
get rid of these things.
I vetoed them before
we installed them.
The travel policy
and getting approvals
from finance for expenditures.
It seemed insane
to me that I would
say, any expenditure
over $5,000 has to be--
or $10,000-- has to be
approved by finance.
And I've got a company
full of PhDs in math.
Like, they know that $10,001
is more than $10,000.
They don't need somebody in
finance to tell them that.
But they might need
somebody in finance
to sit with them as an
analyst and tell them
what things are happening
and how they're trending.
Is this the hook?
Are you coming to hook me?
Oh, because-- look
at your little--
see, that's a Google problem.
[LAUGHTER]
I told you I'd say that.
Does that make sense to you?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
PATTY MCCORD: I don't have
any problem with the system.
It just needs to be transparent.
And it needs to be current.
AUDIENCE: And because
you're paying top of market,
the feedback is
kind of irrelevant.
PATTY MCCORD: No, they're
two different things.
They're two different things.
AUDIENCE: Is there
pay for performance
at Netflix, or not really?
PATTY MCCORD: There's
high performance.
So you're going to
be paid top dollar
for doing a fabulous job
with amazing people on time
with quality.
So we're going to
just pay there.
We're not going to pay like,
well, you did an OK job,
so I'm going to give
you an OK raise.
If you did an OK
job, we're going
to talk about where
you're at and whether
or not you still
need to be there.
And then how I determine
what pay is is market.
What are you worth
somewhere else?
Listen, this true story.
I would say to my
vice presidents,
go interview at Google.
They're like, no.
I'm not-- what are
you talking about?
I love it here.
I'm like, no, no, no.
Go.
They're like, shit, in
Google it takes, like,
seven weeks and five.
I'm like, I want to know
what they're paying VPs.
Just get your coat.
Go interview.
I would tell my employees,
look, when the recruiter calls,
before you say, no thanks,
be sure you say how much
and come tell me.
'Cause that's real comp data.
Real comp data is what
somebody else will pay you.
So it's not just
paying people a lot.
And it's not just paying
people for performance.
It's almost the opposite.
It's expecting
extraordinary performance
and paying you well for
the extraordinary work.
And then the other thing
is not all jobs are equal,
and not all jobs are equally
as important to the company.
So I do also--
so I tend to talk to big
companies now, and lots
of startups.
So startup CEO dinner,
I'm up in the city.
And one guy says,
well, you know,
your high-performance thing,
you don't really mean everybody.
And I said, yeah, I do.
I mean everybody--
you should have
a high performer at every job.
And he goes, yeah, but not
the ones that are unimportant.
And I said, well, really?
Which job at your
company is not important?
He goes, well, you know, like,
like payroll or something.
And I said, seriously?
You don't what
somebody really good
figuring out how to pay your
really brilliant engineers, who
I'm sure are the ones
that are really important?
And he goes, well,
I'm just saying.
I'm like, you don't want
them to be accurate?
He's like, well,
it's just they don't
have to be like-- yes, they do.
They have to be really great.
And I said, hey, by
the way, tip for you.
Your finance
organization hates you.
[LAUGHTER]
And he goes, I don't think you
know my finance organization.
I'm like, oh, hell yeah, I do.
You just told me,
a perfect stranger,
you think your payroll
supervisor is stupid.
They know you think
they're all stupid
because they can't write code.
It's a completely
different skill set.
And furthermore, when
you're not looking,
they're thinking of ways to
torture you, because that's
what finance people do.
So yeah, I don't-- the pay for
performance thing works when
you, you know, what
you do is valuable,
then you should
pay a lot for it.
Do you want to yell?
Or here-- here it comes.
AUDIENCE: So how do you build a
culture of excellence like that
without also creating a culture
of fear and ego and toxicity?
PATTY MCCORD: Well,
fear is a hard one
to get rid of, because
part of it is adrenaline.
So I remember one time, one
of our executives was talk--
one of them was, he
was talking about
that this particular year,
the things that we were going
to do and succeed at were
not going to be incremental,
they were going
to be monumental.
And he used climbing
K2 as his metaphor.
[LAUGHTER]
Here we are.
So at the end--
this had been a
big culture of fear
was the new meme
around the company,
and we're at this
executive meeting.
And it was bigger meeting,
quarterly business review.
And at the end, Reed
and I go to the front.
We're answering questions.
And he says, I want
to hear you and Patty
talk about the culture of fear.
I'm like, oh, for God's sake.
Really?
So Reed says, well, you just
used the metaphor of K2.
You have to have oxygen.
And if you get halfway up
and a blizzard comes in, you
go back down to base camp,
there's no shame.
This isn't for the timid.
So the toxicity and
the egos, those people
just don't need to
work there anymore.
Somebody's got to
just ferret that out.
And you have to--
that's why the culture of
honesty is so important,
so that I can say to
you, hey, wait a minute.
Excuse me, but in this
meeting, she's still talking,
and you just cut her off.
So can you let her finish?
Thanks.
And then you do, and she
lives, and life goes on.
You have to model
the right behavior.
You have to be able to say, that
was a jerk move right there,
buddy.
I mean, you just have to be able
to have those conversations.
It's the shitspering
that gets us in trouble--
you know, talking
shit in a whisper?
That's toxic.
And you can be--
in my book, there's a
chapter about debate.
We loved debate on
behalf of the customer,
on behalf of the customer,
on behalf of the customer.
And you can be pretty
worked up when you're
talking about the product.
I used to tell my HR team, we
are a service organization.
It is not spelled
S-E-R-V-A-N-T-S.
And the people that we
serve don't work here.
The people that we serve are
our moms and our neighbors
and ourselves.
So it's our job to
put together teams
that build incredible stuff.
When I talk to my--
I've been gone six years.
So it's a long time, and Netflix
is a very different company
now.
Netflix is a global
original content company.
And what's very successful
for them now is they've
extended that culture of
freedom and responsibility
to the creative talent.
That's why they get
the people they get.
That's why Shonda Rhimes wants
to work at Netflix and not
at ABC, because nobody's walking
around telling her what to do.
AUDIENCE: I'll hand over
the mike in a second.
Just like, how do--
does it create a culture of,
like, competition [INAUDIBLE]??
PATTY MCCORD: No,
because remember
how I started with team?
So the thing about the
individual competing
with individuals, that shouldn't
happen when you have a larger
collective thing to do.
I mean, it might
happen for you guys
because you have more products.
But these teams
are formed to focus
on solving a particular problem
in a particular time frame.
And teams are formed to do
that because individuals can't.
They can't.
That's the deal.
I tell, back when I
talk to startup guys,
again, I'm like, OK,
in your little startup,
here's the first
sign of trouble--
nostalgia.
Remember how it used to be?
And I tell them, really
successful companies
are not made of 50
people working 24/7.
AUDIENCE: It's
not about product.
It's solving-- it's groups
that are solving a problem,
like functional--
PATTY MCCORD: That's right.
Groups solving problems
that are clear to everybody.
So everybody has a role.
So when people are
competing, then
what are they competing for?
Is it one meaty job and
you've got two people?
That's what drives competition.
Is it that you know that in
the end, there's only one job,
and there's four people
trying to get it,
instead of just picking one?
It goes back to
honesty, I think.
SPEAKER 1: All right.
We'll do two more questions.
Over there, I think,
and then over here.
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.
I actually read the book.
PATTY MCCORD: Ah.
AUDIENCE: Amazing book.
Thank you very
much for the book.
One big impression I
actually got from the book
is one of the major
components for Netflix
to sustain such a
culture and model
is to have a very powerful
and strong recruiting team.
PATTY MCCORD: Yes.
AUDIENCE: And the HR
department was [INAUDIBLE]..
My question is, I guess for
a smaller company, maybe
a startup or even Netflix
in its early days,
where the recruiting
in HR is not
as strong as it is right now,
is such a culture sustainable?
PATTY MCCORD: Well,
since you read the book,
you know that the other
secret of the great recruiting
team at Netflix is that it's
not the great recruiting team's
job to recruit people.
It's everybody's.
And the number one job
of a hiring manager
is to know the right talent
to build an amazing team that
gets quality work done on time.
And so I used to say--
I'll tell you this
one last story.
Back in the day, when I was a
software engineering recruiter,
I studied the habits
of software engineers.
And so I happened to
know that there's always
that weird ethnic
restaurant in the strip mall
that is the place du
jour that you eat.
This is before we
all had restaurants
all over our campuses.
So I'd go find that little
Thai place in Cupertino.
And in the lobby,
they'd have the fishbowl
you put your business card
in, you get a free lunch.
Do you guys still go to those
funky little strip mall joints?
And I'd go, and I'd
just take the fishbowl.
And I'd go to the
back and dump it out.
This is in the old days
before cell phones.
And I'd just dump it out,
write down all the names,
and go back to work
and call them all,
because it was where all
the software engineers work.
And now I say, that's why
God gave us LinkedIn now.
So you can do that.
You should be looking
for members of your team
all the time.
It's everybody's job.
It's HR's job to
facilitate it and to really
understand what the market is
and where to go get people.
But it's everybody's job
to bring great talent in.
And that's the difference.
It's not just a great
recruiting team.
And my great recruiting
team was, and is,
so great there because
they feel like they're
partners in bringing in talent.
They're not recruiters in HR.
Do you have a question?
AUDIENCE: Hi, Patty.
My question is how do
you evaluate or think
of high performance
in the context
of very ambitious and risky
projects that didn't go well?
PATTY MCCORD: Well, I think you
figure out what you wanted to--
you do it like
any other software
product, any other product.
You postmortem it.
When it didn't go well,
you stop and say--
you pause, and you
get the team together
and say, what should we
have done differently?
Did we mis-scope it?
Did we miss the readiness of
the product for the customer?
Was it the wrong team?
Were we unclear about goals?
So I mean, everything
I learned about people,
I learned from product managers.
You start with the end,
and you work your way back.
What are we trying
to accomplish?
What's it going to look like?
What's quality look like?
When's the delivery date?
That's the other thing
we don't do very well,
is put time wrappers on stuff.
So it's like, so yeah,
we accomplished it,
but it was six months late.
What should we
have known when we
made that date at the beginning
that we didn't know now?
So that's the part about--
you talked about development.
That's the continuous learning
part that I think all of us
should do as teams.
Make sense?
OK.
SPEAKER 1: All right.
Well, thank you, Patty.
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
Let's give one more
round of applause.
[APPLAUSE]

Patty McCord: Lessons from a Silicon Valley maverick: new ways of working and collaborating
I spent my entire working life
surrounded by technology and innovation
when I was at Netflix I got to spend
many years creating and living a culture
that's admired around the world it's a
place where brilliant people thrive and
create it's a culture I'm happy to tell
you is alive and well and they're still
pushing the boundaries of how we think
about work so when I love Netflix I sort
of went on this world journey to
discover what the world of modern day
work looked like the world outside of my
backyard outside of the Silicon Valley
so now I travel and I meet with startups
and corporations business schools and
CEOs that startup world it's every
cliche you imagined and more I have seen
at work hammocks swings cats and
bartenders I've been to lovely buildings
of large companies with gourmet
restaurants and art collections I get to
debate venture capitalists and
professors
it's a terrific journey but here's the
really weird thing we still pretty much
all of us do the people stuff the way we
always have I was at a conference on
women and technology at Twitter not too
long ago Twitter and the room was full
of bright business women and engineers
and the subject of pay equality came up
because it always does and one of these
days maybe I won't have to talk about
that on stage anymore but someone in the
audience raised their hand and said how
does a woman ask for a raise and I said
seriously have you been binge watching
Mad Men again it is not the 1950s that's
not how it works anymore we change that
stuff up in the 60s most companies have
complex compensation systems with salary
bands merit increased budgets bell-curve
distributions and if you join a firm and
you're paid 20% below what you're worth
in the open market for talent you will
never catch up the math of a six and a
half percent merit increase budget
simply doesn't work in your favor
horrified she said are you telling me I
have to leave my company to get paid
what I'm worth
yes because unless your company realizes
that it's beyond food or fun or foosball
but simply paying you fairly might be
the good way to start keeping you it's
your career I told her own it it's
shocking really how little has changed
out there it's like we never question
anything we just pile more stuff on we
want to feel our car employees are
contributing like they feel like a part
of a team like they're engaged so we do
an employment engagement survey it's a
form that you fill out anonymously of
course and then we take the results of
that engagement survey and we turn it
into global corporate initiatives and
then we set out to empower you you know
empowerment where I touch you with the
magic wand and I sprinkle you with
corporate fairy dust and I declare
you're empowered do you know why we have
to empower people at work now because we
spent decades taking it away from them
with rules and process and handbooks and
procedures we think we have to teach
people now how to find at work what they
walk in the door with every day power
the power to be great you know I've
found that if you expect mediocre tea
that's precisely what you'll get but if
you expect excellence you'll be
surprised what you get even from
mediocre people what if instead we gave
people the context to operate like
business owners maybe they'd start
acting like business owners we could
teach them how to read a profit and loss
statement how to read a business
and they could understand the machine
and what their part is in it what if we
had imagined we had teams of powerful
independent people at work they
understand the business and what success
looks like you picked them because they
do believe in them they picked you
because they believe in what you're
doing what if then we said we're
expecting you to come into work every
day and contribute with your hearts and
your minds and your creativity when did
we begin to fear and suspect the people
that work for us what happened to the
trust between us maybe we killed it off
slowly with the annual performance
review you know that horrible contrived
process that we've all come to believe
is the best the only way to give people
feedback about their performance at work
and determine their pay hands up
everybody who loves the annual
performance review yeah that'd be nobody
because everybody hates it the givers
the getters the administrators we don't
even measure whether or not it improves
anybody's performance or the performance
of our businesses but we all do it
pretty much the same way seriously can't
we do better than that I mean don't get
me wrong feedback about performance is
really important it matters a lot it
helps us be better it helps us get
better it's really effective when it's
real and it's in the moment what it
includes telling you what you do right
not just what you do wrong there's got
to be a better way to do that so at one
of my startups we're practicing with a
new way of doing it they're requiring
they're mandating that people have
one-on-ones with their manager every
week and every fourth one-on-one is
about performance from the manager to
the employee and the employee to the
manager and sometimes they include other
team members it allows them to make
corrections in the moment and reward
impact it's real and it's alive now I
know you're all thinking that's really
cute but it's too simplistic and that'll
never work in our corporation but isn't
there some place somewhere some dark
corner you can let somebody experiment
with it and come up with a better way
when I was at Netflix we tried really
hard to create an environment where
people could do their best work where
innovators could innovate I remember
when Steve Jobs called Reed Hastings our
CEO and asked if we could create a video
streaming application for what he
referred to as the transformational
device we now know it as the iPad we had
tough deadlines but we made it and it
was a terrific product and everybody was
using it so I came flying into our
product meeting one morning I was full
of excitement touch technology it's
amazing it's so primal it's so human to
point your finger at something and have
it begin to play last night I was at a
restaurant in the two-year-old sitting
next to me was streaming Sponge Bob in
his highchair I can't wait until I walk
into my media room and I swiped my wall
and something begins to play and around
the room they started riffing like jazz
musicians musicians oh we won't make you
get up no another one said you'll reach
in your pocket you'll pull out your
smartphone yeah and on the phone will be
an app the mood ohmmeter
and you'll put your thumb on that app
and it will say Oh patty are you sad and
instantly a romantic comedy starring all
my favorite and actresses and actresses
will begin to play and I'll feel better
and I looked around that room and I
realized that I was surrounded by the
kind of people that if you came up with
a great idea and you put the right team
together you could make almost anything
happen and I started to think about them
you know in a
Raiders are different they approach work
differently they never look back they
look forward and imagine what might be
they don't try and make anything a
little bit better they make mistakes
they move fast they break stuff they get
rid of stuff that gets in their way
and I realized I had become one of them
I no longer spoke HR I didn't care about
best practices or initiatives or
engagement I cared about the pride that
comes from being part of an amazing team
that accomplishes amazing stuff that's
what makes people happy at work and I'm
here in front of you today to start a
revolution because it's time because we
have to the very nature of work has
changed we can't predict the future
things move fast
our computers are in our pockets we're
on the go why don't we start by telling
each other the truth job security is
over retaining people is a measure that
might not even matter we have to learn
to question all the layers of process
and approvals and compliance we have to
remove the obstacles that stand in our
way and slow us down and take away our
spirits we have to begin to think of our
careers as journeys the places we want
to go the things we want to learn we
should each of us think about where do
we want to go and how do we want to
travel I want you to start your
innovation journey today by going back
and questioning the why of what we do at
work and finally and most importantly
have the courage to throw away the stuff
we do that simply doesn't matter
I'm serious this is my revolution you
should join me thank you

We Suck at Culture (Netflix's Patty McCord) | Protect the Hustle
[Music]
blockbuster was hundreds of times bigger
than we it's we listen to you an
earnings call one time and somebody
asked on the Alice sjon antio could the
head of blockbuster what do you think of
Netflix and he said they are a net they
are no one there nothing no one will
ever do this people love video stores
don't ask me about that stupid little
company again for profit will recur it
protect the hustle a show about those
who are in the trenches actually doing
the work
I'm Patrick Campbell and I'm Ben Hillman
and on today's show how paddy McCord
went from border towns and Oregon lumber
yards to building the culture that
brought up this 160 billion dollar
market
[Music]
company culture means a lot of different
things to a lot of different people but
it's not because there's a lot of
definitions of company culture it's
because culture has been co-opted by
things like perks what snacks are in the
kitchen and and ultimately ping-pong
tables right culture is your Bill of
Rights it's your Constitution you're
writing on the wall it guides all of
your decisions it allows you to thrive
and survive I don't know if I exactly
agree no well because if you think about
companies right I think that writing
things down is definitely a part of it
don't get me wrong here but think of
companies like Enron or even more
recently Farrah knows these are
companies that had values like integrity
written on their Lobby wall and still
they acted in fraudulent ways true well
I mean we'll have to see what patty says
culture and I learned a lot of this from
patty it's it's more of the collection
of habits that you accept and nurture
within your organization at the end of
the day it's gonna make or break your
business that makes sense the whole
concept of we are what we repeatedly do
exactly and this is this is ironically
polarizing as we'll find out in a bit
coming from patty McCord and for those
of you don't know patty McCord has been
leading teams recruiting team building
teams nurturing teams for number of
decades in Silicon Valley and outside of
Silicon Valley and most notably she was
the chief talent officer over at Netflix
which is a nice small little company yes
I am familiar with Netflix
well she recently published a book
called powerful which makes some waves
in the world of people ops and it was
built off the back of the infamous
culture deck which seems to go viral
once a quarter or so yeah we're gonna
talk about that culture deck a little
bit later for those of you aren't
familiar because it is a pretty
controversial piece in people ops for
for better and for worse I suppose to me
her views get deep into what is right
and what is the truth and not
necessarily what feels good or what
feels to be the most comfortable but I
think a perfect place to start
considering that culture is who you are
in the some of the behaviors and the
activities and the experiences that
you've had it's actually start with
Padma
hordes background and what we'll find is
it starts in a very very far place away
from Silicon Valley you served your
career in a lumberyard
I doubt high school and I lived up in
the way and I didn't have any work to do
one winter and I didn't want to go home
and mid failure so I got a job in a
lumber mill that's cool and one other
thing that I thought was great is he
dedicated your book to your dad yeah and
I'm gonna butcher the statement but it
was the one of the first leaders you
knew tell me do you mind Tony no my dad
was a border patrol guy he was the
border patrol we moved every two years
of our life from one crappy little
border town to the other he was the
youngest chief of border the border
patrol in Arizona I think about him now
because the kids in detention centers
would break his heart he took it
seriously he was a good old boy grew up
really poor did this job because he had
missed out on the military so it was
closest to it and he was just speaking
of developing hue red for he was a
smartest guy with no education you know
he would run circles around me and he
also he listened right I mean we did not
get along he's a Republican in terms of
but he what I could have a political
argue meant with him and I felt like I
was hurt he pushed me to be smart all
the time
[Music]
so here's a dad story Reed decided that
we were big enough now that we were
interfacing with other companies who had
c-level executives so we were going to
all have C title so you're the CMO and
you're the CFO
so he said Patti I decided to call you
the chief talent officer and I said I
thought that was really great because
like you're kind of like it goes like
with movies you know you're in charge of
the talent and it really is about the
talent and that really is what you do
and I don't think it's dorky at all I'm
like you know what that sounds great to
me I'll be I liked CTO because I can
tell the geeks I'm the CTO but I
remember calling my dad like dad I'm a
cheap oh honey I'm so proud of you
I miss my dad so if you want to call
your dad right now yeah can we take a
break we can't but I can remind you
later to call Tim yeah
well I don't know if I've ever met that
person in people ups like Patti I mean
to me they're always handling legal
paperwork hiring snacks in the kitchen
you know stuff like that
Patti's do exist out there now there's
plenty of non Patti's but the Patti's
that do exist there basically they're
taking people ops from this world of
just making sure check boxes are checked
and I's are dotted and T's are crossed
to this world of performance and getting
the most out of your team and that might
seem very natural to you and and me as
we try to cultivate this at profit well
and we work with a lot of really high
performing companies as our customers
but what we'll find is this is just very
very far from convention
everybody does it the same way so it
must be best practices so I mean nobody
questions anything there's a whole
generation of HR people who are exist to
protect the company from evil meaning
lawsuits from evil employees so they're
convinced that a whole bunch of stuff
they have to do because it's against the
law if they don't it's just not true and
then in the last 5-10 years now the
pendulum is gone mm-hmm and now we're
happy people
yeah and bartenders on the payroll and
eight craft beers versus seven nine
kinds of flavored water and and then the
HR people they don't they don't do
anything and they order t-shirts and do
parties and so they're kind of soulless
lifeless it's almost like HR became
legal and not product so it's crazy to
me that's all my whole point why do we
have a language around product that's
selfless that's straightforward
that's metric space that's honest right
and then we can't like you so let's say
let's use the same metaphor right we
want to develop a product that has to go
to market because of competition in the
next six months we have to have a
competitive offering that addresses
these particular issues that a
competitor is addressing better than
that's us and it has to happen well you
have to have the right people on the
team to do that right you can't go you
can't miss the opportunity cuz you don't
have the right people that's how it
changed it for us we were like oh my god
this is ours for the taking
it's the right team when you and your
team are up against that decision like
yeah we could do that oh we can't
because we don't know how or we don't
have the right people that's why you're
in management that's your job right it's
your job is to put together that team
that delivers to your opportunity and
opportunities come like this right so I
I don't have any problem at all
developing people I don't have any
problems at all
having people learn on the job I don't
it's just that time time thing that we
don't do very well you know I talked to
startups in there like some day and I
start to I talk to corporations they're
like well our five-year plan and you're
both wrong
now the five-year plan is it's a smoking
dope it's just an exercise right wishful
thinking and and some days is - it's not
crisp enough your company is a product
in and of itself and it requires
proactive care and attention to scale it
to high performance and the
controversial piece here really is
around responsibility because it's your
responsibility it's our responsibility
to take care of that company and get it
into a high performance mode or at least
accept the consequences if we're not
able to basically make it great so tell
me a little bit more about that because
I don't really understand how that bucks
convention well it really comes down to
history so if we go back about 150 years
a little bit of a history lesson yeah so
pre Industrial Revolution and in the
industrial revolution working conditions
are terrible you essentially have people
literally who are cogs and machines
people are dying mainly because there's
no labor laws there's just there's just
no workers rights labor movement comes
along and says hey you need to let
people survive and you can't force child
labor all things that most of us can
agree on and may have some marginal
problems here and there but there were
no laws and now there were laws so all
of a sudden you have check boxes you
have eyes that need to get dotted you
have T's that need to get crossed
then post-world war ii you had another
big revolution in labor rights because
all of a sudden the huge workforce
disparity with men and women got changed
where more and more women were going to
the workplace Civil Rights Act of 1964
all of a sudden you have more and more
laws so all of a sudden there's just
huge collection of laws in less than 75
years and who's gonna take care of those
laws and who's going to make sure that
we're compliant
you're not going to give it to the sales
as leaders because they're selling
you're not gonna give you the product
leaders because they're building or
they're manufacturing things so you have
this world of people ops or HR where
it's responsible for recruiting and it's
making sure that people don't go to jail
and that people are essentially taken
care of
things in somewhere along the line we
are on ik Lee lost the people aspect of
human resources or of people ops right
so I want to touch on that a little bit
you said HR has kind of become this
epicenter of legal and recruiting
exactly and as product gets easier to
build it's infinitely easier to build a
product versus 50 years ago let alone
five to ten years ago and distribution
gets harder and mobility of employment
gets infinitely easier thankfully you
know the developed world continues to
develop all of a sudden we're in a world
where your biggest asset and liability
becomes what it should have been all
along your people right so what about
that what about that other piece well
the other aspect of this is is taking
responsibility or this personal
responsibility on on an individual level
and it's tough because people are tough
like for example have you ever have you
ever given someone negative feedback oh
yeah definitely it's it's tough right
because if you're sitting there and you
don't want to be mean you want to be
direct but you also you know you want to
consider the feelings of the other
person and even if you know the feedback
is a hundred percent right and it needs
to needs to be taken care of it's still
really tough but the easiest thing to do
for a manager especially when it comes
to feedback is invent the performance
review right it's one year people ops
handles it you don't have to really take
care of it you don't have to do much and
then you basically absolve yourself with
a responsibility of giving that
consistent feedback and that consistent
checking in with your team members who
seems like a lot it is but but as
Patty's about to tell us it doesn't
necessarily require exorbitant amount of
work it just takes diligence and not
responsibility
well first of all if you've written
anything down which you don't have to
but if you have you better damn well be
doing it because the worst sin worse
than not writing anything down is
writing something down not doing it
I meet founders who really believe and
then they hire the the jerk for their
vice-president of something and they let
you know him or her sort of get away on
the edge cases and that every you got to
remember everybody in the company
watches and that makes them cynics and
that makes you a liar right just that
much harder it's just that much harder
so first of all is are you in walking
the talk is a dumb thing but are you
really saying something once a month
that you're gonna pay attention to and
pay attention to it
I talked to HR people who want to know
about reward and recognition systems and
buy software that takes care and giving
people VIN
like sometimes it's just like that's
what I'm talking about you did that
that's great right so that so modeling
that behavior right so that's modeling
giving feedback but we think that giving
feedback means constructive criticism
means telling somebody something they
don't want to hear in a nice way that
they don't really understand is you're
worried about being nice more than
you're worried about giving them that's
right and so the problem with that is
constructive criticism is not that
effective that bad thing you did again
that's a bad thing you stopped doing
that bad thing okay don't do that bad
thing again the next time you do it
because you will you'll feel bad it's
called guilt tripping our parents use a
long time eventually it works right
because you're like I was I wasn't
supposed to do that bad thing but if I
catch you instead doing the good thing
right this is right here in this moment
right when I you don't ever talk in a
meeting but you grouse about it
afterwards and I call on you and you're
like yeah I don't agree and here's the
reason why
then then to follow that wonderful
moment up with it that's what I'm
talking about right we can't you don't
have a voice unless we hear it
here's an example when I met Reed early
at our first company I mean he was a god
I don't even know if he'd run a team
before so here he is CEO of a company
he's a complete geek too at this point
and his original product that he wrote
the software that he wrote was a runtime
error detection system so found errors
in your software as you were making him
that kind of guy
so he was very negative right he was
critical all the time so I said I got an
assignment for you this week I want you
to find five people in the company doing
something right and tell them and he
said why I'm like cuz I don't think
you're very good at and I think you
could use the practice because we mean
I'm not very good at I'm like you know
we've been together now for a year and
don't recall you ever telling somebody
in the moment great job it's like well
that's you know not necessarily my job
like do you can you are you like afraid
of the assignment figure you can't he's
like oh I could do that this afternoon
I'm like okay here's the deal they have
to come tell me they have to come tell
me that you talk to them you can you can
bribe them I don't care but I have to
hear from them so money goes by and to
go by when he goes by and I'm like so
what up he's like well you know I'm a
busy guy on the CEO at the company I
don't have time to go around do all this
stuff I'm like do you want me to tell
you five people and you could just go
tell them and complete the assignment
he's like no I think I figure it out
then figure it out Thursday afternoon
somebody comes in and goes wow I'm gonna
take my wife out to dinner tonight it
was an amazing day rate came by my
cubicle and he knew what I was working
on and he said well I just I was just
looking at what you were doing this
really great stuff it's like I just it
was that simple and that modeling in the
moment that's culture it's what you do
right if you say you're gonna be candid
if you say you're gonna be open and
honest with each other it's about that
stuff it's about the little stuff you
can make it up as you go along right so
you just you have to be somebody that
poses the question hey by the way I've
noticed we're late all the time and I'm
worth that's becoming a norm what do you
guys think about it okay what are the
pros and cons of allowing that legal
room right because it's inefficient
that's
that's why talking about politics in the
same way I'm gonna stab you in the back
get it and I've gotta turn around and
gotta kill you I gotta get rid of the
body I mean this is this is a lot of
work to do that it's much easier for me
to go do making me crazy stop doing that
and then you do and then I don't have to
sabotage you that modeling in the moment
that's culture it's what you do if you
say you're gonna be candid if you say
you're gonna be open and honest with
each other it's about that stuff it's
about the little stuff culture is the
sum of all the little things it's
modeling that behavior and those habits
that you want to be successful and I
really love the example of positive
reinforcement versus rebuking someone
because I think that that also bucks
traditional convention as well I mean I
guess to me it's tough because does that
mean that I'm not supposed to tell you
you're doing a bad job I mean that's
kind of my natural reaction to this I
don't know if that's what Patti is
saying sure and personally this is also
really hard for me because I naturally
see what's wrong for better and for
worse but studies have shown that giving
positive reinforcement does work on a
much much better basis my whole thing
here is that the struggle really comes
in and owning who you are and owning who
you want to be as a company in
particular right and even Netflix
struggled with this
yeah they did because some of the things
that you're gonna choose is behaviors or
some of the things you're gonna really
observe or want to basically nurture
they're not necessarily the most
politically correct when you write them
down on a piece of paper but what you
have to remember is that you're not a
friend Club you're striving to succeed
at something you're striving to be a
high performer and at the end of the day
that requires making those tough
decisions and being true to that journey
that you're on you can own mediocrity
though right I mean Patti's basically
saying as long as you write it down and
own it that's okay I think you're
technically right but I don't believe
that's the intent that Patti's going
with meaning but I guess I guess you're
right though definitely if it's on paper
and you're gonna own it and you want to
come in you know four hours a week etc
that that's totally fine just not here a
profit
but but putting it down on paper that's
where this Netflix culture deck comes
into play exactly but it wasn't as
simple as just putting it down on paper
and for those of you who don't know what
the Netflix culture deck is this was
basically what Patti and the rest of the
team the exec team at Netflix were
putting down on paper their culture
their values etc and the reason it went
so viral is because it wasn't just this
Enron list of values on the wall it was
something that was so real
and and and had a little bit of this
not quite PC language in it especially
when it came to describing the behaviors
that they were looking for at Netflix
Patti points out though here that a big
piece of this is that this was not a
short process
you know it took ten years to write did
you know that oh I didn't know that yeah
so we wrote it every chapter was written
after the chapter before it so the first
chapter which is the values part right
which we wrote as behaviors when I was
there we rewrote at least parts of that
six times right so we'd take things out
or we put things in and this is how we
would test it we would start with our
executive team and say okay let's look
at the values and see if they're still
valid
okay the value of curiosity names
somebody right name something on your
team that it exhibited that give me an
example of that on your team in the last
week like if we went around we couldn't
come up with anything we'd say oh I
wonder if that's still if it's something
we don't see all the time are we sure
it's still valuable or do we say it's
important but we don't have any anything
that reinforces it in the culture like
here's a funny one I wanted to write the
first time read and I brain started it I
get on the board with my whiteboard with
my pen and I write we don't like stupid
people because we can't write that I'm
like but it's true I mean if people just
can't intellectually keep up you know
you have zero tolerance for them so why
don't we just hire smart people I guess
you can't say you're gonna hire smart
people like why not like what if we just
said you had to be smart and then I mean
we used all these you know people would
come in and go do I have to have an IQ
test you know and we did it you know and
then it was interpreted as he had to
have a degree from a good school or you
had to be mathematically smart cuz
that's the only thing we cared about or
so it was really interesting to kind of
parse through that over the years
because at one time we had like
intelligence and then it was about like
innate curiosity and so we wordsmith all
that so that was that always that's the
first chapter of the culture deck so as
in Reed's book so one of the things that
took a long long time to get the bench
strength to do is to get people who
could
articulate deliverable so that people
could do them so the key to the culture
was about performance was that you got
great stuff done on time that served the
customer with quality that's it right
and so you had to be able to articulate
to your team's what that was right you
had to have the right that's where high
performance comes in you need to have
people that perform that task in that
time frame so that articulation is sort
of the underpinning of the culture which
is about deliverables about reliability
about dependability about counting on
each other notice how it wasn't just
about saying something or putting
something down on paper that may not
necessarily sound the greatest when sat
out loud but it was also making sure you
had the team to back it up and in this
way it was on you to basically
articulate this to the team as an exec
team as a management team and this is
this is insanely tough people are at the
center of this we've belaboured that
nobody is arguing with it but what I
think people are struggling with is
while it's easy to agree with this is
definitely something that is hard to
execute exactly this is insanely
difficult to execute on because you're
basically pointing out ideals and then
following through on those ideals with
imperfect parts right you know humans
right and and not wanting to you
necessarily do the right thing because
it doesn't feel great right and so for
the rest of this the rest of the show I
think we should focus in on actual
applications and we're gonna start with
how you can start to implement these
concepts into probably one of the most
important parts of your business the
hiring process and Patty actually starts
off by telling us how she would have
handled the James day Moore situation
and for those of you who don't remember
James day Moore was a Google engineer
who wrote that very controversial memo
where he was basically positing that the
biological differences between men and
women were the reason
that there weren't as many female
engineers and let's see what Patti has
to say so like every reporter in the
world called me about that Lee would you
fire him ah Mike Oh dork move I'm like
but you know what I like to think I
wouldn't hired him you know he was a
twit the interview you know English you
do that for some stuff like that though
you know what you know you know exactly
who he was I betcha that he was smarter
than his last boss in the boss before
that the one before that
in fact he probably had some very
defined opinions about the way he wrote
code spaces over tabs okay you know what
I mean right you get these people who
have these like you know quasi religious
beliefs about certain and you know this
here's how I interview I everybody asked
me my favorite interview question I
don't have one you take anything on
their resume anything oh you're at
Google and you worked on search you're
in charge of you led the search you led
search for Google oh you're on the team
that worked on some search products
which products how many people are on
the 400 okay so you're an individual
contributor okay so tell me with what
you what you did and what you learned if
you had to do it over again you'd do
differently tell me something about
something that worked out but it could
have been better and you would have done
it differently right so now I'm going to
look for people who want to solve
problems right and that person wants to
tell you about their accomplishments you
just pull tell me more tell me how you
did that really what kind of boss was he
did you like working for him did what
what was good about that right so it
makes you crazy I like that because it's
because the the response to the you know
the Jane the would not what he did but
your comments about oh he's probably
he's both you smarter that's boss
Mother's someone might go oh he just got
a chip on a show
we like that right but there's a
difference between someone who has a
chip on their shoulder and someone who
has that quasi-religious they actually
don't like it yeah you don't like the
chip in the front I don't like the dough
in there so I don't like the tude
it just bugs me right it's like so how
you get that thing off because it's a
it's an impediment right and so you're
gonna carry this stuff around with you
for the rest of your life and that's
your excuse for not getting along with
other people it just it this is my thing
about it's not age its maturity right a
mature person says yeah you know I was
young right and I thought I was the
smartest bear in the room and yeah and I
we got to doing that so maturity is a
pretty big deal here and I believe that
Patti's major point here is that it's
not that you shouldn't have that
discussion it's just you should examine
how that discussion is handled I think
you're right and this is what patty gets
into when she talks about this concept
of hiring fully functional adults which
is a completely disconnected concept
from actual age but what I struggle with
with this concept around maturity and
fully function add ult's is that it's a
bit of a chicken or the egg I don't know
about your career I bet it's in your
career as well but definitely for my
career every job I've ever had I was
treated like a child not you know
actually like a child but in the sense
of here's this policy don't do this do
that I wasn't allowed to kind of
flourish with my own judgment and that
hindered a lot of different things that
hindered a lot of different creativity
it hindered a lot of different curiosity
points and ultimately probably didn't
get the best performance out of me
because that's why I ended up leaving
those those places that I was at people
become political that's just part of
being in a work environment and I'm a
Democrat and Republican you know I'm
talking about gossip you know like like
children but Patty's got a really good
way to level set those expectations and
it's through the onboarding process and
I'll let her explain it because it's
just a phenomenal metaphor for what
we're talking about
you guys are kind of triathletes your
triathlete
so here's the deal you're very smart and
you have a track record of getting stuff
done that's really valuable to us we're
going to call that cycling and then
you're really good at articulating
hiring leading people that's that's
really great we're gonna call that
running you're also really adept at
company politics because it's matters in
your matters that your company matters
how much budget you get how many open
wrecks you get how big of a team that's
swimming we don't have goggles we don't
get wet we don't have a pool and it's
not like that swimming isn't good and I
get that like we're just we're kind of
like biathlete we don't know and I'm
like it's it's gonna be sad you're gonna
miss it you're gonna be like where's the
pool look I'm I'm awesome at swimming
right and oh by the way of those three
things if that's your biggest strength
you're in the wrong place and you can't
you know it is real in some companies
and it's you got a habit to survive
Yahoo is very much that way yeah it was
and because so many changes you know
everybody had to manipulate where they
were in the organization and so it was
tough so it was hard to dig through and
find the people that I actually wanted
to get stuff done there do you find and
this is like tangential to this but do
you find with the concepts of debating
you know openly the concepts of you know
making your voice heard you know getting
more feedback in the loop fighting those
inches.you thing is hard for companies
because a lot of times when companies
are ready to hear what you have to say
unfortunately there are 50 people 150
people you know it's a it's kind of for
you and your leadership team it's about
conducting the orchestra yeah so you
have to teach people how so here's a
couple of tips like they're it's hard
thing to say that to a bunch of
introverts who don't have the skills to
do it right so everybody needs to be
speaking up and if you candid and be
straightforward with people and you know
you're looking around at people who like
haven't had a conversation with another
human and a pretty long time so but you
have to teach them to do that you have
to say when you're in that meeting
right if there's people who aren't ever
speaking in the meeting is it because
they don't belong there right or they're
just there to witness or they're there
to witness and grass afterwards whatever
it is but you can say I haven't heard
from you what do you think on this right
what's what's what what are your
thoughts right you can call people and
ask them the other thing is you can the
the people that are the problem finders
that think they're very valuable problem
finders always think they're special
people and they can be if taught so
finding problems isn't all that hard
right I mean and having it be somebody
else's problem but you can say wow I
understand you think you thought that
was a pretty bad decision we made so two
questions one if you were me what
decision would you make more importantly
if you were me what information would
you want to know to make a good decision
about like that yeah and you can teach
people and once you do that you do that
every single time then nobody's going to
open their mouth and complain unless
they got an idea about how to fix it
when people get confused about I don't
believe in development I do I do but
it's in every moment it's in every
conversation the deep part of the
culture isn't anything that we wrote in
the document it's that hunger for like
what's a new way of doing it how do we
how do we explore that that curiosity
that so I would rather develop and
nurture curiosity than anything else
curiosity and judgment those two are my
pillars right and if you have people
with good judgment you don't have to
have that many rules so so check
yourself when when you get pressure to
like it's about time maybe we should
write a policy that says people
shouldn't do this then you if you don't
have people who aren't smart enough to
make the right call
curiosity and judgment were the biggest
underpinnings there for me because if
you hire a fully functional adult and
you get them over their corporate PTSD
of politicking and protecting their own
dog ball all of a sudden you have a
situation where you don't need a bunch
of rules you don't need a bunch of
policies and all of a sudden you don't
need to explain to them how to actually
perform right because they perform out
of their curiosity and drive and you
don't have to deal with a bunch of BS
just because they're adults here's a big
gripe though none of us are particularly
good at this especially when with things
like scaling and a lot of it just feels
like spouting wisdom like you know hype
beasts we don't we don't want to be hype
peace so how do you deal with a
particular problem like this how do you
handle it
well I think this really comes down to
what Patti's been talking about right
your first step is to codify the
behaviors that you're observing and that
you want to nurture not the ones that
you want to aspire to be if it's not
something you're actually doing don't
write it down right as patty already
said from there then it really becomes
your job to protect the hustle in a way
that you hire the right people you
nurture the right people and you get rid
of the wrong people
I don't think patty would like that
phrase the the wrong people you're right
patty would not like the phrase the
wrong people but I think that she would
agree with the sentiment that I'm trying
to get at which is ultimately it's your
job to make sure that you're not only
protecting the hive by hiring the right
people and they're trying the right
people trimming the people who aren't
working out but it's also really really
great for that individual because if
they're in a role that they're not
succeeding at they're not happy and it's
probably not great for them either and
you don't want to just have them sitting
there miserable and kind of
commiserating with the team that they
really should be moved off of anyways I
I really like her take here but the
concept does make me a little bit
uncomfortable I think it's a lot of the
conditioning that you have to get over
we've been conditioned that any
departure of someone from a role or from
a company it's just a terrible thing and
in reality it's it's probably the best
thing not only for the company but also
that actual person and so I want you to
pay particularly close attention to when
she talks about performance plans
because I think that crystallizes
this entire concept beautiful I tell
this HR people I'm like yeah sometimes
you hire somebody to do a job and then
they do it and then it's done and now
we're worried about what to do next and
they did that thing that they're really
good at doing that you really need to
get done and now it's done and you don't
need them to iterate they don't want it
that you know the Builder is not the
maintainer usually right it's two
different frames of mind right so when
you make the builder of the maintainer
now you've made an unhappy person right
and you also made yourself son happy
because very good maintainer
this is something I struggle with though
because like you just says it took you
four years to get to that infrastructure
how do you how do you maintain so right
now if I look at my team my direct team
as well there's a couple of people where
it's man that reliability the high
performance there's potential maybe they
just need to be coached maybe they just
need this methodology that I think is in
Chapter six yeah yeah you know the one
where you go six months out and you put
the movie do you have the amazing team
and you work backwards and you could
come back and say you know man I love ya
I wouldn't be here without you you've
done an incredible job but like going
forward when we're starting to talk
about complexity and scale accuracy you
know you're never on time and it's I
don't I get it I mean we got to here
with it but we're not gonna get there
with it so in your mind when you're when
you're looking at the six-month movie of
like this is reality it's got to be
someone that is already clearly trending
towards that you know it doesn't have to
be you can still you can say hey I just
described the to what the team's gonna
look like and I gotta be totally honest
with you if you walked in the door I'm
not sure I'd hire you for that team but
man you got the spirit and you you know
you got the DNA and you care about the
customer and I'm willing to take a risk
if you will but here's the deal if you
can't do it we
to have somebody in the job that can
write and so when you set somebody up
that you're gonna take a risk with them
then that's really different than we can
do it you can do it I'll develop you
I'll coach you I'll get you there when
in your gut you know that's not going to
happen you know so if you hire something
that's not confident you fail they
didn't fail they don't have any guilt at
all they just they couldn't do it
you got them through and they can't do
it now you do that sometimes when you're
making it up because you don't really
know what it takes and it's sometimes
when you hire that person you think was
going to be perfect because that's the
way you would do it you realize that's
you know they're saying it should be I
should hire somebody completely opposite
of me who have thought of something
completely different so now I got
another me now we're making the same
mistake twice so that's that I got rid
of performance improvement plans for
people that I knew we just didn't need
anymore right and I don't and I had to
be able to say I love you I do what just
don't need you anymore man so I want to
come put you on a 90 day performance
improvement plan you're a terrific
performer I just don't need you to back
up sing that song anymore right so in
your great backup sing all right so what
band can you join next right so we can
do that why would I do that so I had to
get rid of that and instead I would say
okay instead of us spending the next 90
days proving you're incompetent which
you aren't in writing in front of your
peers why not just write you a check and
we can start brainstorming where you can
go next right what should I you know
what are you gonna take away and what
are you gonna leverage and how am I
gonna reference you and how gonna make
that happen right and we can be all sad
about breaking up but we can also be
grown-ups about moving on right my my my
internalization that took me years to
realize that this is what I did I wanted
us to be a great place to be from
[Music]
man to me that's that's the perfect
thesis a great place to be from I almost
don't want to say anything else
because that's just where where the
concept should end but to make sure
we're doing our diligence here culture
is that collection of habits that you
nurture amongst the people that you
accept and that you keep within your
organization and it's everything right
and I have to say I was wrong from
before you know a culture is not a bill
of rights it's not a Constitution it's
not that things that you write on the
wall it's as patty says so brilliantly
it's about the little things absolutely
and the leadership at your company it's
their responsibility it's it's a
responsibility of everyone but
especially the exec team and the
managers to make sure that they're
reinforcing those habits in every single
moment that they can and they're not
absolving their responsibility to check
boxes and performance reviews and things
like that that feel like they're taking
care of that problem or that opportunity
and culture but in reality they're not
really reinforcing positively those
behaviors that you want to see in those
habits that you should see within that
company but what's beautiful about this
is that when you get this right and so
much of it is intent and so much of it
is just fighting the good fight every
single day even though you know it's
never going to be perfect but when you
fight that fight that's how you create a
great place to be from

Netflix's 'Powerful' Corporate Culture Of Freedom And Responsibility: Author Patty McCord | CNBC
we have this big saying now in my field
that's called empowering people and it
makes me crazy that's why I named the
book powerful it's like the reason we
have to empower everybody is because we
took it all away
and so you know you walk in the door
with power and if we recognize that
about the people that we work with
then we're gonna quit doing a bunch of
crazy stuff that we do that doesn't
matter like what like annual performance
reviews and then everybody talks about
how difficult it is to give hard
feedback to people and I say is there
anything else you do in your life once a
year that you're good at right so you
know if we give people regular feedback
and we talk about it how it's working
out and we're honest about what work is
for people then I think we all have a
better opportunity to get stuff done and
that's the type of approach that I would
think would work very well in a startup
company maybe in Silicon Valley where
you know they need something brought in
but you're not a huge company I don't
know that it works in huge companies
tell me why you know I don't I don't
know that it doesn't work in huge
companies because huge companies don't
try ok so when I talked to huge
companies I say look I'm ok if you go
back and you choose to operate the way
you always have and do things because
that's the way everybody else does it
but choose it and so at this point we've
got management practices that we all do
and because we all do it we call it best
practices even though we don't measure
it so I just think that we can apply an
innovators approach to the way we manage
people - that's what I learned it's it
sounds good except I you know I I don't
necessarily I mean managers have the
opportunity every day to do that above
and beyond other difference review
mm-hmm and it may or may not happen so
they're not acting as adults either
mm-hmm I mean there's two people in this
party right yeah on this transaction
yeah so how do you there's a lot of
people in the party and managers it's
act like an adult you know it's about
discipline rather than process so if you
have a discipline that manager meets
with an employee on a regular basis then
you can make every third or fourth
meeting about performance and it should
go both ways I mean that's the the other
part in the example you just gave is
the manager is supposed to be the adult
and the subordinates supposed to be the
child come on
you know every single person who goes to
work every day as an adult they have
adult responsibilities so if we both act
like that then the power dynamic shifts
you know one thing that strikes me when
I think about places where it's fallen
down where you don't get that kind of
feedback a lot of times it's because
people are just so busy keeping up with
the daily expectations yeah they don't
have time to do these longer in-depth
processes I mean that that it's asking a
lot when people are really producing a
lot every day yeah I'm not talking about
a longer in-depth process at all I'm
talking about a 15-minute conversation
on a regular basis where you go how am i
doing and/or I say to you as my boss you
know you could help me out here right
and it's the conversations that's
regular and easy like breathing it's not
this big heavy process can you do that
when you manage let's say more than
thirty or fifty or eighty or a hundred
people you can try and it's in managing
30 50 or 80 or 100 people is a pretty
difficult task to do and so the other
thing in my book I talk about is smaller
teams tend to get better work done and
so part of it is the way you organize
it's a whole system that I'm talking
about which is just this idea that we're
going to come to work and do great stuff
and be proud of what we do before we go
home and I think that's a human Drive
the the the deck that you wrote the
freedom and responsibility deck 124
pages sheryl sandberg has said is the
most important document that's come out
of Silicon Valley yeah did you find
challenges as Netflix got bigger and
bigger find challenges with trying to
stay true to them I didn't write it we
wrote it collaboratively over a period
of 10 years so that's another message
which is time yeah it's not frozen in
time and you don't pick up my book and
go let's do that and we're golden right
it's that you pay attention to how you
manage people as much as you pay
attention to the work that they do is
that something that HR departments are
responsible for is it something that it
has to come from the top down it's both
it's everybody right I mean if it's
everybody's responsibility to have a
great workplace then it'll be a better
workplace but when it's just the job of
management or it's just the job of HR
then it doesn't get done what are
go ahead you're at Netflix for 14 years
you basically were at the company when
it started yeah if you're a company
that's already in existence you've got a
culture in place how do you break that
it's much easier isn't it to establish
that culture oh for sure for sure right
but but if you're in a company that's
been around for a really long time and
you're nervous about this is what
happens when I talk to big corporations
they're nervous because the little
companies are nipping at their heels
right and so they realize they have to
be more nimble they have to be more in
the moment they have to be able to
change faster and so these big heavy
processes it just slows you down right
so it's a way to so you don't have to
change everything I say just throw away
one thing that doesn't matter and if you
had to pick one thing that would be the
first thing you would throw away
probably the annual performance review
it's that egregious it's yeah I think
it's too egregious I think everyone
hates it and I don't think it
accomplishes what it sets out to do so
in my innovative Silicon Valley world if
I said hey let's create a system that
gives people feedback you would never
come up with that it's dumb
all right let's tell everybody wants to
hear something that's vaguely related to
what they do and by the way tell
everybody at the same time so that as a
manager you are trying to spend tight to
pay right right and so you know I
believe in market-based pay so that
system of looking backwards is really it
just slows you down you had situations
at Netflix where you paid somebody
double because you didn't want to lose
them you doubled their salary mm-hmm
what explain the theory wasn't because
we didn't want to lose them it was
because they had a particular skill that
was really important to getting great
stuff done for us at the time right and
hardly anybody gets double their salary
over and over and over again it's a
matter of supply and demand so it was a
person that had been with us what I
thought in my HR mind was a relatively
short time but had a very specific skill
that was very rare and so I realized
that it wasn't that I was paying him
twice as much to keep him it was that oh
my god he's worth twice as much to the
five other companies that needed his
particular skill so that's where those
broad brush you know this is your job
your paygrade this is what everybody
makes I'm not sure if that's completely
true anymore hey there thanks for

welcome to this week in startups I'm
your host Jason Calacanis and we've got
a very special episode and guest for you
today Patti McCord was a key member of
Reed Hastings epic run in building
Netflix from a quirky blockbuster
competitor that's biggest innovation was
of course mailing their patented red
reusable envelope and now they are
Hollywood's dominant creator of
entertainment the firm recently
announced over 110 million global
subscribers putting on them on pace to
create the largest paid subscription
service in history yes the history of
humanity it's clear that Netflix is
going to hit 250 million people in the
next couple of years and I believe it
could hit a billion in the next decade
decade or so and that's obviously a big
deal Patti co-created the famous Netflix
culture deck and she has some very
unique views on creating a winning
culture in her new book powerful
building a culture of freedom and
responsibility she details that and her
journey at Netflix and it's inspiring
tactical and a quick blunt read I give
it my highest recommendation it's
amazing a must read for all founders
however reading what it's like to work
at Netflix on Glassdoor and Korra shows
a much more complex picture with people
detailing a culture driven by an intense
fear of being fired with one former
employee doing a deep analysis of
linkedin's data showing that Netflix had
a magnitude more former employees than
their contemporaries Google and Facebook
current and former employees say that
Netflix place twice as much as their
competitors but maybe because they can't
keep people a Netflix believes their
sports team not a family player is gonna
come and go and as you know there's
little loyalty and sports teams today I
hope to get to the truth about Netflix
sometimes
our polarizing and quixotic culture from
the actual person who architected it
welcome to the show yeah thanks for
having me
it's great to have you the book is
amazing congratulations maybe we could
start with you giving us a little
background of how you wound up at
Netflix and what your role was there and
then we can get into these controversial
and quixotic issues well I didn't roll
off the turnip truck and end up at
Netflix I was in Silicon Valley for a
long time so I started out as a
recruiter I worked in big companies you
know my first company was a hundred
thousand employees and I sort of went
down from there so I did Seagate I did
Sun Microsystems I worked at Borland and
then what I left Borland to join Rita to
startup called pure software it was a
geek to geek software tools company and
we grew through merger and acquisition
so we were a hundred people with 200 400
800 right so every time we acquired a
company we doubled what I did at the
time was a very traditional HR I would
take their employee handbook in our
employee handbook and smush them
together and try and make the fewest
people mad and then just sort of keep
doing that over and over again so we
sold the company it got acquired as
these things happen and Reid made some
money I made some money
I started consulting he invested in a
bunch of companies other companies as an
angel one of the companies he invested
in was Netflix and he was chairman of
the board and then so the company had
like 30 or 40 people had a rudimentary
idea about what the product might be it
had due dates and late fees it was
mailing DVDs because he thought DVDs or
the future I thought it was a really
dumb idea because DVD players cost $800
and we all had VHS players right yeah
but he said I really want you to come
because I want to create the kind of
company that if it were successful we'd
still want to work there and I said
really if you did that how would you
know and he said I'd want to walk in the
door and solve these problems with these
people every day like damn that's good
right and he said what about you and I
said wouldn't it be great if we were a
great place to be from
hmm like you like someday if you looked
on your resume and said you were at
Netflix that meant something right right
because it would be from Apple cruder
right I mean that's like you know you
were at during wow that must have been
cool odds oh my god sorry right and I
didn't know at the time that that
concept would change the way I thought
about everything mmm right so if I you
know it's a great introduction thank you
yeah so if I think about creating a
place that is a valuable thing to have
on your resume a great place to be from
yeah then I'm not going to obsess about
keeping you right and that is I think
why the book is making some waves right
now it seems to be a little polarizing
and it speaks to me and the investments
I've made in 150 startup companies and
the companies I built one of the things
that you say over and over again and you
repeat which is really the job of
management is to repeat the mission over
and over again you say hire adults and
to trust them and give them freedom and
responsibility when did you have this
sort of realization that you have to
hire people who are adult or who I guess
act like adults and and where did that
term come from because I noticed you
said it at least a half dozen times in
the book I think it was partly how I
grew up in the Silicon Valley
so Netflix was a part of the last calm
bubble right the one that broke yeah and
at the time we're going through yet
another wave of engineers as gods
everybody's got to be treated special
everything has to be beautiful and
wonderful and meanwhile we had a company
that had a very high it was very capital
intensive and so we had to buy DVDs and
stamps and envelopes and most the people
that worked and Netflix stuffed them in
the envelopes I mean really it was very
physical stuff yeah and so I would get
these people who had come down and they
did interview and say you know at my San
Francisco startup we have a granite
conference table and we all have air on
chairs and I would say you know those
air on chairs cost 800 dollars
you know how many how many customers we
could make happy right for an Aeron
chair I mean I divided everything by 20
bucks DVD cause and so it was partly our
poverty that helped us focus right but
we didn't you know and that before so so
one of the stories that most people
don't know about Netflix was in 2000 we
laid off a third of the company hmm so
we were almost out of money but the
subscription business doesn't actually
start to multiply until you have a
paying base that stays with you for a
long time so we're very early into that
business the bubble burst those were our
customers we were going to go public in
2000 we're gonna be a portal we were
going to be yahoo for movies Wow yeah
and we we we did it we pitched Sand Hill
Road you know we're drinking champagne
reading caviar we're like a hundred
dollar stocks private jets we're in
right let's do it bangers pulled the IPO
Wow September 11th happens
anthrax happens yeah did I mention
everything goes through the mail yeah
Wow
great think about that also you
mentioned you glossed over one thing
that people don't remember about the
Netflix story which was originally
people paid late fees on DVDs right so
we had changed that model a year or two
before that to become subscription
flat-rate you just keep your two DVDs
yeah so you get the next month raizy
crazy experiment right and it's like oh
god I hope this works right nobody
almost revolted over that right yeah was
just hard to like it didn't make sense
to people but it was one of those like
well it might be the only way if it
worked it'd be really cool right it
compounds over time once you understand
how's the subscription business model
worked not very many people did I mean
the only examples we had of that at the
time was like health clubs AOL right
sort yeah but it you know so not a lot
of for a consumer product right and
against blockbuster yeah there are a
hundred times bigger than we were so the
story is in October of 2001 we laid off
a third of the company I say goodbye to
anybody who wasn't technically
working on shipping DVDs by mail almost
everybody in middle management because
it was wasn't efficient to have
somebody's job to be telling somebody
else what to do so I only wanted people
were actually working on the product one
product dvd-by-mail that was it nothing
else right and honestly I said goodbye
to a lot of the privileged complainers
and whiners and right now people that
and I and people yeah somebody said we
can't let this guy go he's a brilliant
engineer Mike yeah you know he plays his
guitar and complains about his t-shirts
yeah like a lot and he's a good guy but
seriously I cannot convince him we can't
buy t-shirts anymore right you know it's
gonna make him mad I know it's gonna
make him mad but that's the honest truth
so what happened was that Christmas
everybody stayed home
DVD player strapped to 99 bucks you all
had one under your Christmas tree and
the only marketing we did was a coupon
inside the box that said try netflix for
free hmm and our business took off right
now we don't have any money I can't hire
anybody right we're doing twice as much
work with the third as many people and
it was more fun when you got out that
middle level of Management well and when
I reverie buddy there it was so clear
our purpose was so clear it was a
life-or-death situation so I realized
that the adults that got it that knew
how to do it and knew what the timeframe
was and what you know and it was the
only way we could keep growing was if
you told somebody else that it was great
for free right cuz we have no money for
marketing other than those coupons right
and the DVD envelope the patented DVD
hello but had that little piece you
could rip off too and hand to somebody
yeah so the like virality I don't want
to be nostalgic about the time because
it wasn't always fabulous and it was a
long time ago in dvd-by-mail is a
different a whole different thing than
the company Netflix is today but what's
what's important about what we're
talking about was I realized that
that the things that I was doing and
traditional management practices that we
were gonna need when we went public in
2002 so it said everybody time to grow
up right I looked around and said grow
up we're already pretty grown up right
right so if I start putting in all of
those I'm gonna slow us down and I'm
gonna have people think about something
other than making our customer
extraordinarily happy and that was a
secret sauce yeah and you mentioned in
the book the job of the manager is just
to hire great people and who are
passionate about that work and let them
do their thing there was something about
your ability to hire people that was
better than most companies in Silicon
Valley do describe that a little bit it
seems like you just had this core
competency of hiring great people you
know was it firing people quickly what
was it so many good people it's a whole
system right so when you get to so that
the the story I just told you describes
when we wrote the chapter in the culture
deck about high performance right and we
explicitly wanted to write down this is
what we mean by high performance and
what I meant was and then I realize it's
not just that you work hard or that
you're smart it's that you're the right
person on the team for what we're doing
at that time
right so for example when we went public
I looked around and went oh man you know
I don't have a lot of people that have
worked for a public company before in a
couple of critical roles and it's not
like they can't evolve into that someday
but we're public like right now right we
need people now now right so my the the
hiring firing thing let me tell you
about the whole the shore so creating a
system the operation to support a high
performance culture took about four
years right and so I had to step back
and think ooh dur why am I using
headhunters they don't know anything I
don't know right right why
outside outside headhunters why am I
doing that why do I have two different
sets of recruitment when they're the
good ones why don't I just bring them in
ah right why don't I know and by the way
I'm a recruiter so I know they're not
that special they're just that worked
well and it's the beginning of social
networking so I'm thinking wait maybe we
can just do this right right so you
don't say goodbye to somebody that you
might might not be the best person for
the next team you're trying to build
unless you have a core competency that
you're gonna create you're gonna hire
great ones
so I'd build a recruiting firm right
then I had to say wow if we hire people
to build something and they build it and
then it's done and it's fabulous and now
I actually don't need a new product to
be built I need some people to maintain
them and these are the wrong people then
the last thing I need to do is put them
on a performance improvement plan when
they're not they didn't stop performing
just finish the job
they're great Yeah right and the the
difference and this is the nuance that
most people don't get about this is when
they get cranky about it yeah well why
didn't you find another place for me
well when we finished building the
software systems to ship DVDs and it did
it extraordinarily well we weren't going
to create another dvd-by-mail product
right streaming wasn't physical
distribution it was a completely
different product it was a completely
different business right and so it
wasn't that they weren't great they were
amazing they're just not the right piece
so then I had to say well how do I think
about separation mmm right and I one of
the things the Netflix culture deck I
don't like going back to is the adequate
performance gets a generous severance
package because usually what happens is
the business changes and what your
fabulous performance was now is adequate
because it doesn't match the new stuff
right it's not that you stopped
performing it's that you did you
completed your mission you know and back
to what you said about a manager's job
is is to build great teams so you cannot
point to HR when you hire somebody and
they're incompetent they have no fault
in that scenario you hired the wrong
person right so yeah especially if it's
a skills thing right so you got to get
better at interviewing to do that so
that became a cop
see that was what manners so now when I
consult to startups you know I tell the
CEOs look recruiting is your job forever
hmm you should always be interviewing
you should always be looking for talent
your employees should see you
interviewing three times a week yeah and
that is something that people think oh I
got to deal with that early on in my
career but I can then I just hire some
people and pay him thirty thousand
dollars every time they bring somebody
in who's good and it never works
nope you got to do the work yourself all
right when we get back from this quick
break I want to talk about some of the
quixotic things that people hear about
and how you got to them and two of them
that come to mind is the no vacation
vacation policy also the no expense and
travel rules and treating people like
adults when we get back with Patti

thanks again to WordPress for supporting

this amazing episode okay welcome back
to this week and start us my guest this
week Patti McCord who worked with Reed
Hastings to make one of the great
companies of our lifetime and in the
history of business Netflix it's been
god six years since you worked there
yeah but you spent how many years there
14 14 years what an epic run you've had
there it's got to be mind-blowing to
look at it now you know I'm kind of a
serial entrepreneur ah once I once I
found the startup world that was like my
mojo and the thing about Netflix was I
got three startups without leaving home
right so my first four years at Netflix
were could we come up with a business
model that might actually work before we
ran out of money in this story I just
told you was that was pretty close yeah
second one was dvd-by-mail the third one
was creating the infrastructure to
support streaming and Netflix now is a
global content producer it's different
now it's on another business must be
mind-blowing though when you watch the
Emmys or the Oscars nostalgic at all I
guess of a clip just and and I watch the
Emmys and the Oscars and I see in the
audience you know people I remember
hiring you know it's just I'm yeah I'm
incredibly proud the back to the
treating people like adults yep
two of the things that people have tried
to copy about Netflix and I think
sometimes they get it wrong but
they look at this in the context of
giving perks giving perks in this
constant perk based culture you know
material rewards and let's face it
nonsense in Silicon Valley foosball
payables kind bars and anything that's
not the core business and the customer
and two of these that you go into in the
book that people always get wrong I
believe are the no vacation policy
policy sometimes interpreted as
unlimited vacation policy today which is
absurd but talk about how you got to
that point of hey we're not gonna have a
vacation policy you're an adult do what
you need to do as a very specific story
we had gone public
we were audited by KPMG the the process
I used before that was you accrued a day
a month you had 26 days a year and you
Trude up when you left the company so
when you live the company I'm like so
what do I owe ya and you'd say I guess
26 days I'm like great how was Hawaii
thinking glad you're going yeah but so
so they said came down and said we don't
like this all that's fallen to the
bottom line you're technically paying
people 13 months a year fix it here's a
sample policy sarbanes-oxley guys came
down said pretty much the same thing
here's here's typical policy you can
automate it cuz you're a cool company
and I was like uh you know why do I have
all these stupid bank holidays you know
when I don't celebrate Diwali or right
you know it just didn't map my workplace
and it wasn't flexible so Reid came down
he's like what are you upset about I'm
like a stupid policy and he said do you
have to have paid time off and the HR VP
that I really was on my left shoulder
said of course you do everybody's got
paid time off right and then the person
that's been hanging around with him for
ten years says you mean legally yeah so
I can look it up and I find out for
exempt employees for salaried employees
no law in California says you have to
have paid time up right so then I think
have I ever fired a salaried employee
for being tardy or absent no in fact I
if I think about it a couple of people
haven't worked out because they work all
the time they don't get much done and
they're weird
right right people who work all the time
are weird huh right everything becomes
so dramatic
yes it's their whole life and you know
sometimes you want them to just chill
out and come back always that awkward
weird person who just like is there on
the weekends doing it really seriously
okay so but and then I realize okay if I
really time is managed locally right
time is managed at the group level and
every team has its own rhythm right
urine close happens every year in the
first two weeks of January because the
year has ended bad idea to take a month
off in January if you're in finance
right so and and engineering teams they
work on pushes they work on schedules
and I realize that everybody has their
own rhythm in their own organization and
what's more important is to focus on
deliverables and schedules and
accomplishments and customer
satisfaction and I don't care how you do
it right right
I don't and I didn't want to have my
people have the job of policing them
right right oh here comes HR better
watch better lie right which is what
people were doing I remember when I was
coming up in the industry like okay you
have this many personal days this many
sick days of efficacious okay so I'm
gonna take my trip to Hawaii then I'm
gonna pretend I'm sick for the day
before in the day after then I'm gonna
take a personal day on the way time back
and it's all like some bizarre life and
honestly at this point I had become
partial geek myself right so I'm just
looking at efficiency model saying
seriously if that's where your brain
power is going hmm
that's a really bad ROI for us right you
know so how about I remember one
engineer I hired he's like you know I've
worked at all the big companies in
Silicon Valley and I hate HR people and
I find I make it my business to you know
mess with you and and be a rebel and
screw with your policies like you're no
fun
anything to rebel rebel against bro so
that's how we did it and and like
everything in the deck and you'll see
this in my book I started out as an
experiment I would stand up and go look
if everybody if all the lawyers and
everybody I talked to our right this is
a total disaster you're all gonna cheat
it's gonna be terrible we're gonna have
loss of productivity but I don't think
so I mean I trust you guys so if that
happens then we'll just go back to the
way everybody else does it you know best
practices well yes and the other best
practice that keeps coming up we'll get
to expenses in a second but I think the
more interesting one is the
soul-crushing yearly 360 review the
moment of time when everybody gets to be
told how inefficient or bad they are
were then where were yes how terrible
you are yet you still work here and
here's your arrays and now you tell me
how terrible I am and we all feel
terrible for a month and this massive
anxiety leading up to it you did 360
reviews or yearly reviews for at sun and
everywhere else you work Seagate and
then at Netflix you guys threw it away
overtime overtime so how people took it
where people upset that they took away
the review yeah sure some of them and we
experimented with it year over year we
used to do here's an example we used to
do 360s anonymously because there was a
belief on the executive team that people
wouldn't tell the truth if they had to
reveal who they were and my engineers
would argue with me about that and felt
that that was counterculture if we were
gonna be straightforward and honest with
each other and we're gonna have candid
conversations in radical honesty was
important then why would we do that and
I would say couldn't agree with you more
I'm outvoted sometimes I'm not the CEO
right so one year they signed their
names inside the feedback huh but just
wow I love it I love her
I wouldn't do that you know
Kevin right and and you always knew it
was him anyway because of he was so
articulate and good about the feedback
and I I would always go back and Kevin
that was so useful thanks for giving
that to me but now he signs it and Reid
says to me just yeah yeah and so that
was a year that we experimented with
that and I know it's ongoing we mess
with it all the time but here's what I
do know the annual performance review
tied to pay is absolutely hated by
literally everyone the HR people get no
joy in this yeah the IT people hate this
the managers hate it the employees hate
it and so I do what I did with that was
I used my product manager brain what is
this process for okay what's the reason
why we do this other than the fact that
everybody else does it so I'm gonna
pretend they're don't live it's a best
man it's yeah so okay screw that so is
it a feedback mechanism do let's say and
if I always tell people like let's say I
was in a room with a bunch of product
managers or innovators and said you know
I have this hypothesis that giving
people feedback might result in better
performance what do you think yeah yeah
that makes sense okay let me let me
whiteboard this idea I have once a year
in writing that doesn't actually say
anything will give you some sort of
vague words that have something to do
with what you did the entire year last
year and even though our business is
changing significantly we may or may not
need those skills anymore and you may
need to do something differently we're
gonna base next year's pay on that yeah
that sounds like the worst product that
were constructed to celebrate everybody
else in the table would be like okay
there's one idea anybody else can we get
another idea out here and then I and
people say to me well you know one of
the problems with feedback is it so
difficult to do and you're really good
at giving feedback and I say you know
why I am cuz I practice tell me one
thing you do in your life once a year
that you're good at
so that's where that you know applying
that innovators I got jealous of them
Jason why are they the ones having all
the fun yeah you know why couldn't I
innovate
why couldn't I step back and say well
what might be a and and since I've left
I've learned a lot about giving feedback
from professional coaches yeah
what is the s practice if you will of
giving consistent feedback what does
that look like for a CEO or a founding
team member or just a manager what's the
right way to give feedback what's the
fright right cadence is there some I
think whatever whatever cadence your
one-on-ones are and I think they are
really important face to face
conversations with the people that you
work with make you know it's okay to
mandate it's okay to have structure it's
okay to have discipline to ensure things
that get things get done efficiently and
effectively you can do that with that a
policy mm-hmm right so one of the
companies I work with they mandate one
on once every two weeks you meet with
some someone you work for and that's you
know and when they skip level and talk
to employees say you know when you met
with Jason last two weeks ago what do
you say
oh he's canceled on four weeks in a row
right and then I can go back and go oh
problem mmm right and then they say
every third one-on-one is a performance
conversation right right and so when
you're doing that every six weeks or so
I can say hey you know why haven't you
finish this project we talked about like
almost two months ago I mean I'm a
little pissed off that you hadn't done
that and you say well patty you said
you're gonna talk to the manager and
that other team and tell them I was
working on it and sort of paved the way
for me and I say oh you're right I
didn't hear let me call him right yeah
that's good I'm sorry huh right so now
you're you've been mad at me and I've
been mad at you and we have this
conversation and it's done right we
don't wait eleven months for me to say
remember in February
when you didn't do that thing yeah yeah
it's August right go back in a time
machine yeah and so I think you can have
really honest conversations with people
in the money in the moment the other
thing about feedback that gets lost is
the most effective feedback from human
to human is positive hmm we think
feedback means constructive criticism
i'ma leave again bastardized that
concept instead of going up by the way
before we get started on the rest of our
one I want you were amazing at that
meeting yeah like I'm telling ya
everybody would told me that was
incredible you were so articulately so
clear about what we're doing do that
again and you will do that by the end of
the day hmm all right we get back after
this final quick break I want to ask you
about my favorite kind of
confrontational device that seemed to
really resonate with the right people
the adults at Netflix which is the stop

about it he loved it okay let's get back
to this amazing program hey everybody
welcome back to this week in startups my
guest
Patti McCord who worked at Netflix on
that amazing culture deck you can just
type in Netflix culture deck and you'll
find it on the interwebs it's been
viewed tens of millions of times it's
kind of like a Bible but here today
we're getting into the why and the how
that these devices and those slides got
put together and that was a living
document it's not like it was written
once and you know came down like the
commandments this was something that was
worked on for years correct 10 years and
we used it as an internal onboarding
document ah so it is not a Bible not a
bike it's not a treatise it's not a
manifesto it's not a it was the way we
worked and we wanted to describe it to
people and when read put it on the
interwebs you didn't tell me oh I was
like great now you're gonna scare away
all of our candidates and he's like well
maybe it's the ones we don't want but it
changed the way we interviewed the day
we released it amazing let's get into
why that is right after you tell us
about what start/stop continuous this
devices really resonate with me and I
like immediately wrote it down and so
I'm gonna do this at lunch today mm-hmm
tell us what start stopping oh it was
one of the experiments that we did
around 360s we wanted to have some
structure you know we're we're a company
full of Engineers and the original 360
process included rating and ranking
people on the six the their six values
and putting them in charts and looking
back at last year and you know looking
forward it next year and putting written
goals and objectives and keeping them
it's just too time-consuming right so I
don't know which of us found this I mean
it may not have been me
and I'm like well maybe this is just a
little structure we have around it so
here's what I'd like you to start doing
it would be better off together if you
could start being more honest with me
instead of I find out from somebody else
that you were mad at me or that you
should have told me you could tell me
what you want I'd like you to keep doing
the amazing work that you do because I
just your trusted colleague I really
like working with you and I and I'd like
you to UM
stop telling you know again reiterating
stop telling somebody else stuff that
you could just tell me right let's make
that okay okay and we did it that was
the structure that we put around the
written 360 feedback but at our
executive team we practiced it one year
in front of each other Wow right and it
was so powerful because you had to be
really honest and then and the other
thing was you know you'd give somebody
feedback look I think it's really
difficult my team has a really hard time
working with you because I kind of never
know where you're gonna be coming from
and you say well you just you know you
just get mad at me I get and I know okay
you've given me that feedback five years
and so I think it doesn't matter and
another colleague ago actually let me
give you an example of how it does mmm
right and it was brutal but it was so
great and we would all go back to our
teams and say hey I learned something in
my feedback session yesterday at a staff
that I want to share with you guys
because I think it resonated with me and
I need your help right I need your help
in
helping me to get better at that and so
then team started doing it themselves
right they're like well if we could
handle it at our executive staff in
front of a bunch of adults at our staff
why don't we practice doing it there and
so that's another example of I didn't
have too bright a policy right and I
didn't have to make everybody do it
consistently yeah right just like a nice
little device and a habit I love those
little devices that don't you easy to
remember yeah they're lightweight you
can get back to work it's not arduous
and okay let's get into something that I
think is really telling the stated goal
was to be a high-performance work
environment for adults so this meant
that when people came to you and they
wanted to get experience or they came to
you and said hey what about my career
development you told them what well
first I would first is probably a more
of an ongoing conversation okay anyway
so I kind of know where you're drifting
yeah and first ice I would say let's
take a look at where the business is
going and what's really important to us
right right and you know I know for
example that it's really important to
you because you've told me many times
and everybody else around you that if
you're not a director by the time you're
40 you're gonna feel like life as you
know it is over
we don't really need a director in your
role right you're great at what you do
we love it a lot the company does not
need that title and that level because
that's not the scope of the job and I
understand that's frustrating to you but
you can be a director at lots of places
and if that title is the single most
critical important thing to you in your
life right now then go get it yeah go
for it go for it right and and we should
figure out a way to do that so that
doesn't harm the team or the company but
let's just get real a bit I'm not saying
it won't be some day right I'm just
saying it isn't now and I need to be
real with you because I need you to not
feel free to write right and so you know
it's one of the things sometimes I go
into these little startups and the title
wait I get five levels of VPS and a
thousand employees right no it's like
overkill it's overkill and then you
fight for that you know you fight for
your relative so the customers as
opposed to the business you know score
metrics and delighting the customer
people start getting concerned about the
career development of individuals and
we've been trained to think well you go
to a company the company is responsible
for your career development and that's
who's gonna do for you but you say in
the book listen career development at
least that Netflix was on you this is
your responsibility is on your on you
for every one where I just lie about it
right it's it's a myth it's a myth yeah
it's always been that way
right it's always been you know Johnny
could happen nice we're not gonna it's
not it's not I'm you know it's in the
book it is not a company's job to make
happy employees hmm this is probably the
most candid you are in the book you know
most people believe that you are
supposed to make your employees
delighted and happy and walking on air
and if that takes kind bars and Fu's
tables and if you go to Google and they
have the endless swimming pool and the
volleyball is that wrong is it wrong for
them to try to make everybody happy and
make that the focus if you're out of
business yes right but we don't have
that situation right now because we have
a lot of money in the system and we have
a lot of comparing notes in the system
and everybody's used to all of this
stuff and now that we've given if given
us we it's hard to taketh away right
free food free food and and and then you
know what I worry about is that now that
we've replicated Google and made work
the place where you never leave because
you don't have to that we're going to
create a whole generation of these
weirdo people who never leave work
it's like why are they all you know
fraternizing with each other because
they never leaving there's a bar yeah
right and you serve dinner yeah you know
here's a story I just told somebody this
morning I said you know I remember when
we had customer service inside our
building and I walked up and one of the
guys was watching something let's say
extraordinarily inappropriate on his
laptop right and somebody else was
standing behind him like who who and I
said oh okay everybody heads up see what
they're doing here and what they're
talking about is things that you do at a
bar right right but do you see any
little wine glasses upside down yeah see
this big it's like that's because this
is not a bar a little umbrellas this is
work right and now I walk in and there's
four kinds of craft beer run I think you
know how does Silicon Valley reverse me
to when we blurred the line between bars
and works oh no it's you have I mean
I've at my events I specifically tell
people they just don't have hard liquor
like have the wine and beer for one hour
max and these nighttime events these
all-night parties it can just lead to
problematic but the question you asked
me was sort of how do I feel about happy
employ there's not always a direct
correlation between a happy employee and
good work and so oftentimes when I talk
to particularly HR people who tell me
it's their job to make employees happy
before I what I used to say is you know
that's not a job but now I'm kinder now
I say you know your company really well
pick five people that are
extraordinarily well regarded who do
fabulous work and are really stars in
the company and I want you to ask them
this question tell me about a time at
work at this company that you did
something that you felt make made a
difference just tell me that story and
every story will be something's hard
it's hard right it's always this when
you go home and tell your pet you know
your spouse or whoever spontaneously
tell your cat oh my god we did it today
yeah
got it done today was such an awesome
day at work you don't stall odds
you don't say , and there were macadamia
nuts in the cookies yeah oh
MJ right right that's the thing about
the high performers that you're looking
for the adult high performers they're
gonna be in sync with that they're gonna
want challenges you talk about the book
that the challenge is what it's about
not the foosball table and the kind bars
and the craft beers you know I think
it's some of it is will grow up a little
and will want more and will want more
complicated stuff and will want to
accomplish something I've been doing
this my whole life
and everybody wants to be proud of what
they do everybody wants to feel like
they've accomplished something and the
accomplishment makes you pretty darn
happy so listen don't get me wrong I
threw some killer parties right to
celebrate achievement ah so you know I
slide a well yeah we were talking about
that customer like this morning when I'm
reading the Netflix customer base I'm
like oh god I remember the chart that we
did at the theater in Los Gatos that
showed we had gotten to our millionth
customer
amazing 1 million commas here we go 1
million customers and reads like god
isn't it just the best feeling I'm like
I want to make a rug of it and roll on
it a million people would want to do
this and that that's worth celebrating
yeah hey let's talk about this consumer
science meeting I thought one of the
interesting areas in the book you get
into is not super controversial but I
think it's very meaningful is the
distance between the information in the
company what's said on the quarterly
reports and the frontline people whether
it's customer support or just people
working there you say in the book if
people if you don't tell people what's
going on in the business and candidly
what the big challenge is somebody else
is gonna tell them or their minds gonna
wander to some crazy dark place and it's
gonna be wrong talk a little bit about
what's the right amount of information
how to share because this consumer
science meeting
thought was instead of computer science
meeting it was the consumer science
meeting talk about the origination of
that and be a pact it had this is
another myth and lie mm-hmm
we no longer particularly in tech in
text everywhere right like III want to
say internet interweb companies but what
company isn't right is there is there
any company that doesn't have a right so
in consumer facing organizations in the
modern world today and probably for the
last twenty years our work has been very
collaborative and the idea of like you
throw it over the wall to the silo of
marketing is not actually how we work
not at all right so that startup
situation actually extends to almost all
corporations now which is when you want
to create a better experience for the
customer in the room is engineering and
customer service and marketing and right
so it's a collaborative cross-functional
thing that we do anyway and so that that
was just an example of of a point in
time communication vehicle to make sure
that people were informed about each
other and that questioning of what are
your motives where are you coming from
what are you trying to do I can be very
very very critical about what you're
doing if I'm doing it on behalf of the
customer right so if I am going to war
with you in this great debate about the
Q we remember hey here's what I'm gonna
watch yes at some point the data showed
the Q made no difference that you
existed because you were on a
subscription plan and you needed to fill
your queue to get your next disk yes but
that didn't exist anyway you extreme
whatever you want it instantly yeah it's
part of a brand right yes and all of a
sudden the queue goes away this was a
big religious debate but you had it
based on data and in one instance you
talked about Reid who seems like a
tremendous leader to me he's pretty
pretty good guy pretty down-to-earth -
it seems yeah he had two people fight it
out in a debate over a contentious issue
right another side of a spin it was yeah
they took each other's sides and what
wages I they were told to take each
other take each other's sides and what
was really interesting about that one
was it was a little bit of a tribal war
mmm right it was I think it was
marketing and content and and the two
leaders were really articulate and
really charismatic and both of their
side arguments were really good it was
it was hard to so when they took each
other's side in the debate of course
they were super dramatic about it they
took down each other's personas and it
was really entertaining we tried to
model debate a lot because it's hard to
know how to be right you know in the end
it's a judgment call right and so the
the thing that people can really learn
how to do to further their careers and
make them more valuable and have a
greater wonderful you know work life is
to learn how to ask questions using the
scientific method I have a hypothesis
right I think that if we did this it
would result if we did exit would result
in why for the consumer behavior and I'd
know why because I'd measure it at this
time in this way so when an employee
would say to me I don't understand what
we was doing right that seems like a
really stupid thing that they did why
we're the cue I would say ask two
questions the second one is more
important one if you're in management
what would you do second one if you're
in management when information would you
want to make a good decision about that
hmm so I met a start-up CEO who said to
me you know I'm a fail fast kind of guy
right and I really like we're making
this stuff up and so I reward failure
every time I see somebody who fails I
give him a bottle of champagne it's like
well that's stupid yeah because now
you're just encouraging mistakes so
nobody's gonna do the right thing
they're just gonna reach for the wrong
thing and so he said yeah and you know
what else I do I'm always stand-up and I
met
when I made a mistake like that's great
that's a wonderful thing to do as a
leader Part B is I was wrong on this
decision here's what I knew when I made
the decision here's what I know now
right right here's what's happened
between then and now to change the way
to inform me to make a different
decision a little forensic and
self-awareness and back to the it's
called the code post-mortem I learned it
from engineer right it's like you I'm
from Texas my mama says honey difference
between a wise man and a fool is the
wise men doesn't make the same mistake
twice
exactly and now we now we put it into
you know management speak about you know
the continuous learning organization
right which is a wonderful thing to do
but you have to celebrate doing it hmm
but you didn't hire let me know if I
have this correct if young people wanted
to learn and have and you know start
their career off at Netflix you just
simply didn't have the time for that or
you just chose that you know what we
don't want to be the career development
place if you want a career development
thing there is a career development
thing at Boston Consulting Group or
Goldman Sachs like here's the here's a
change here's the difference we didn't
create a structure to support that
particular and it may be different now
at that particular methodology what we
did was say and it wasn't that we didn't
hire young people we did and I know that
the company still does we would say
we're gonna surround you with people who
are really good at this
and they and they're you're gonna learn
a lot by being on a team of really
competent people and I found that to be
absolutely true
when everybody around you is as good as
you or better than you jump higher hmm
you know you I used to say to managers
you know if you expect me the awkward II
that's precisely what you'll get right
but if you expect excellence you'll be
surprised what you get even from
mediocre people yeah you know that had
this experience because when I was
training for the marathon
a friend of mine invited me to go
running with his two friends but they
were much faster than me
and I was like I don't know if I can
keep up with you guys and then I started
running with them and you know what I
started to keep up yeah you know maybe
not for the last mile I I would come in
two minutes behind them because they
would spread the last mile but I was I
was a better runner because of it yeah
and you know the example I just gave you
is when you don't know much but people
constantly say help me with your
thinking think harder about that what
would you do let me force you into
thinking in a bigger broader perspective
than you might have I personally think
you learn more about what's important to
you in the moment where sometimes those
structured learning situations don't get
me wrong I love them I mean I love the
MOOCs I love the you know online learn I
love all the ways that you can improve
yourself but I find that the best
catalyst to make it happen is around
other people who are really great - yeah
having that so so friends yeah
mentorship is you know pretty compelling
right if the people around you are just
great at this you're gonna just look at
them and yeah so what we weren't in my
time particularly good at was
particularly good at the process and the
structure around it again it was one of
those things where I would have to weigh
is creating the curriculum and the
system that puts everybody through it
worth the effort if the business is
still changing significantly yeah in the
top of the show I talked about how it's
a little bit polarizing on the glass
door and the core is of the world and I
always know that when I see the three
and a half stars it's just like Yelp
there's one group of people who it's not
for in this one group of people who it's
for but there was a reoccurring theme of
this fear of getting fired speak to that
is that a fair judgement of that intense
period of Netflix you can't speak to it
now but there seems to have reoccurring
theme and people like oh my god people
get fired around here and in fact
somebody did a little study and they
said like oh the the ratio of past
employees to current employees was like
this incredible outlier for Netflix when
compared to Google and Twitter why is
that what's the
well I just I just told you what are the
fundamental reasons yeah three different
companies right sure okay so if you took
whatever whoever's the lowest and you
said that was the turnover for the
dvd-by-mail business that was a turnover
for the early-stage startup business
this is the turnover for the people that
build the streaming technology right
right and this is the turnover for the
people that are working in Hollywood oh
by the way who are not engineers who
work on streaming right it's a whole
different cohort whole different whole
different company needs a whole
different group of employees so so a we
were just straight about it right and B
it was the right thing for the company
the customer at the time and yeah so you
know here's a story that that I always
loved we had somebody who was talking at
a big management off-site that we had
and he was talking about this is the
year we were gonna climb mountains you
know no more incremental changes in the
product it was big old moves and he had
shown these beautiful pictures in this
presentation of you know climbing k2
yeah and at the end of the conversation
the end of the meeting we eyes had a
thing where Reid and I would go whoever
would come up front and anybody could
ask any questions and the person said
what about that culture of fear I need
you in Patti to address the culture of
fear right now and Reid said you use the
slide that said climb k2 right you have
oxygen yeah right
and if you don't make it and you have to
go back to base camp nobody goes oh you
know you didn't do a good job right
right it's scary right okay she's doing
fold effort big bold things are scary
and and it's not for everybody and not
everybody makes it and not everybody
makes it and so you know and and the
other thing I've I could wave a magic
wand and change I would remove the word
fired from our vocabulary weapons aren't
involved there is no blood nobody died
it was awesome and when you use that
word you make people feel ashamed hmm
when is the right word then how do you
contextualise interviewed me said what
severed my
but you know you move on yeah I got
interviews I credit a guy the other day
and he started off with the you know you
just use people you just hire them and
throw them out what kind of heartless
company is this right I mean he went off
it was Fox News guys taking me on and I
said are you in the same job you had
when you left college yeah so he doesn't
know you know I've moved upward and
onward I'm like like everybody else I
think one of the things you're hitting
on is that on a generational basis we
have this concept that it was a family
and that we were gonna be with companies
forever and we lied and it was not true
name one of them that has never laid
anybody on to like you like Alliance
decades it's been decades since you get
the gold watch after 34 years and so if
you know that in reality your idea that
I'm not gonna take this person who's an
expert at the postal mail and say let's
figure out a way to deploy you in
Hollywood to sign up producers and
screenplay writers like that makes no
sense you have to just say goodbye to
that person good luck on your next
adventure you not only do that yeah you
say oh my god how are we gonna leverage
what you did here yeah right what are
you gonna do next with that you now walk
out of this great place to be from and
say what did you do it's exactly what I
did right right
I you know I realized that nobody really
knows how to do this or how to think
about it and so that's why I wrote this
book right I didn't do it because I
really needed another job but I did it
because I feel passionate about it and I
want to make a difference and I can
because of what I did tell me how you
work with startups I know that that's
the new passion and when you were just
talking about the gold watch companies
they're the ones that call me now really
yes there was how do we fix this how do
we fix this banks car dealerships yeah
huge like in the companies that use the
word institutional learning we can't
keep you know we can't get rid of that
guy because he has institutional
knowledge how do you feel about those
people with the
institutional knowledge and I say it's
probably really important in
institutions yeah company natural
historian Society they want me to come
and fire everybody up to act like
Silicon Valley I'm like how can they
when they have to ask eleven people for
permission to do anything yeah right I
mean it's just the can't you can't be
that so now so that's where I get the
calls right now it's hysterical
the startups are they throw the culture
deck on the table and say we want to do
that and I say well let's get started it
took us ten years right and oh by the
way the culture deck has a description
of what worked at Netflix and it may not
work for you and so you want to start
with what are you building who's it for
right if you have a beauty product your
consumer might be different than if you
have a technical heart piece of hardware
right server server yeah in a different
product right you it's a you know it's a
something you hold in your hand that you
ship in a box versus you you yeah right
a broadcast right it's a whole different
world and yet everybody should think
about doing things differently right my
book tour has been amazing because I'm
behind the scenes at TV networks now
right I've never been there before and
it's a very different world right
and so the Netflix culture deck wouldn't
work at all right right and when I
talked to my Netflix friends now that
are in the Hollywood side of the
business they say that the most
compelling part of the culture deck or
the culture itself now is not
necessarily internally it's very much
about extending that freedom and
responsibility to the people who make
the content yes if that is an unintended
consequence that I never put together I
don't think you did either which is No
when you said to the people coming to
work and building the servers and the
DVDs whatever hey listen be an adult you
have freedom
who knew that taking that and applying
it to directors would make orange is the
new black
who knew I mean who
when I got rid of the time off policy or
we didn't Institute financing approving
all expenses I mean who knew that
wouldn't blow up right I didn't I didn't
I didn't see those things coming and
when when nothing happened you know
that's the other thing about innovation
you know this because the companies you
work with you know you do it and
everybody says it can't be done it won't
work and it doesn't blow it up then
you're like what else can I miss with
you know the reason the list of reasons
of why something is not going to work
it's always the mind can always make a
very long list and the reasons of why
the no expense policy which we didn't
get into but you know hey listen you
decide what's reasonable expenses like
oh my god people are going to start
chartering jets to go to their sales
meetings like this is know they're gonna
look at that and say it doesn't make
sense to spend $50,000 on a private jet
to make a $5,000 sale I'm not gonna do
it that's right but it might if it was a
five hundred million dollar sale and
then you had to be there tomorrow
afternoon absolutely right and in New
York you had to be there at first thing
in the morning and there's not a delta
flight that leaves in time for you to
get to JFK and get it so that's that's a
judgment call that adults make yeah
right it's a judgment call that adults
make and having somebody say I'm sorry
you're only approved to at your level
for expenses up to $42,000 mm-hmm yeah
right I mean so that's we're treated
like a child so leaving it you know
bring it back together
the the way this stuff works is by this
constant diet of context what are we
doing who are we serving how does it
work what are the levers what are the
trade-offs right what's important to you
what's important to me can we go do
those things and be aligned without
having to micromanage each other right
that creates trust it's very interesting
because when you apply that to
television because I remember in the
early days of the streaming service you
guys were running around Sundance
because I was covering Sundance as a
journalist at the time
and you were buying all these art house
movies you were the new Weinstein
company etc without the bad stuff and
you know it was like oh we're gonna buy
these things but then you went into TV
TV's are totally different business TV
is for the masses it's different than
art house films but you made that work
as well without saying oh we're gonna
give you all these notes and make you
make uh what do they call a pilot it's
like go make the entire series you
created weeds you're you're a smart
person
go make oranges like bring us back
tennis isn't that a great story I love
that story that Ted told me yeah and
what I love about this story was Ted
Saran does his head of content said
Jenji Kohan came in and she pitched the
idea of orange is the new black
literally just pinched it and you know
and it's quirky right it's the unknown
actors very diverse cast the bad male
prison female prison drama with the and
the the the pitch that she made was it
was the backstory of each of the people
it wasn't the story of the white woman
going into prison and she'd just come
off of weeds
and and I think back to what you just
said there is something I'm you know Ted
and I are good friends it's like we do
have this proclivity to really love
great stories they're quirky independent
stuff so it's like a full circle isn't
it yeah right so so if you think about
the quirky independent movies that we
bought back in the day at Sundance right
it's kind of like making the quirky it
actually Netflix premiered a whole slew
of original content at Sundance this
year right so went from like a purchaser
to being actually the originator of it
yeah it's so cool and it comes from all
those quirky decisions about the DVD
business except it also comes from a
deep deep deep long longtime knowledge
of what people like to watch hmm
so that data and then now and the notion
that a great story is a great story
everywhere in the world mmm right that
it was you know back in the day in the
dvd-by-mail day we one of the reasons
why we were able to take off and was
that we had quirky weird stuff you
couldn't get anywhere else
it was like miss Kim's DVD in New York
whatever
translation foreign film you can UK and
there was an audience for it I mean I
used to say I'll tell you like big truck
movies and by God we got him and
somebody does yeah I mean at and at the
same time Holly was saying let's make
something for everybody it's really
interesting like Netflix actually became
this place where the artists who were
being treated like children in Hollywood
and we're being told dumb this down make
it for everybody can you take out these
decisions that make the film a little
bit dark and just make it a little bit
happier like let's change the ending
let's make somebody not die at the end
let's make them because they have a
different business model I mean it's
again it's a different it's a different
business model so you want to create a
different product which is the whole
point I'm trying to make yeah right it's
not that they don't have broadcast has a
very different audience like we talked
about before we started this
conversation today right you your
audience for the podcast is
significantly different than broadcast
and so you want you have a different
product for that that makes sense no I
do not want a three-minute discussion
with you they want to stick the ministry
to unpack this stuff maybe some people
do they do trust if you're a founder of
a company and you've either read this
book or you've looked at the slide deck
or you're gonna read it now the book is
powerful building a culture of freedom
and responsibility it's what I love
about the book is it's so efficient your
writing you're a great writer by the way
yeah and it's one of the things I cannot
take is when people use too many words
to say things that could take less words
the efficiency of the book it's so
candid and blunt it's a great listen on
audible and there's a really nice thing
we're talking about earlier we're having
coffee at the end of each chapter your
editor or your coach summarizes the
bullet points and the takeaways like
you're in a college class and it's like
the thing at the end of the workbook and
it's a different voice and I'd love that
because it gave me this chance to
reflect on and I found myself taking
notes listen I've been doing this for 25
years and I learned a lot so when you
are listening to this I want you to
the show and I want you to go by
powerful building a culture of freedom
and responsibility by Patti McCord you
you may not agree with all of it
listen it's a I think there's some
polarizing views here but it's candid
just like Netflix was and look what
happened to Netflix is gonna be a
trillion dollar company with a million
subscribers you heard it here first
what a great hour thank you so much for
this it's been super fun okay we'll see
you all next time on this week starts
bye bye
[Music]

Patty McCord, former Chief Talent Officer, Netflix
so I want to talk to you as fellow HR
people how I start out and is it in HR
was I was a recruiter I worked for very
large global corporations and I worked
my way through my HR career to be a
startup kind of gal and as I started
doing startup kind of gal stuff I
started doing HR very differently so if
you've read some of the stuff that I
helped work on with a Netflix culture
deck or the article that I wrote for the
Harvard Business Review you'll know that
I'm a little bit radical so I'm gonna
start today by asking you to suspend
what you do and how you've learned to do
it and the great professionals that you
are and come along with me and a little
bit of a journey and this is my theme
but here's what I learned to do
differently and I want to teach you guys
a little bit about how I think about it
you know I think sometimes in HR we sort
of where if I had a helmet on it would
have a rearview mirror if I was a
professional HR person I would say what
are our best practices how do I look
back at how we've always done this
before and make it a little bit better
and I want you to just believe that for
a second and say to yourself what if in
everything that we did we began with the
end in mind what if we said we want to
work in companies and create companies
and be part of companies that have
amazing people in them who are
passionate about what they do who make
incredible contributions and the results
are absolutely palpable and measurable
how would you do that well first you'd
think like a businessperson
what are your outcomes right in a
business you have many ways to determine
whether or not you're successful metrics
you should know the metrics of your
organization what are they is it profit
is it cost savings is it growth you know
how is it that you're going to determine
how the company is succeeding metrics
usually involve numerals in case you
don't know that so esoteric like
employees will be happy and engaged is
not a metric that's that's an objective
okay I'm going to do some market you
need to know
it is who your competitors are what the
landscape is you'd need to be able to
think like an investor so that you would
understand when there are market forces
that are changing your business or other
things outside of the organization that
are changing the landscape that which
you operate that you understand that you
need to understand what your
contribution is either to your industry
or to society and again back to the
metrics and within the context of all of
that
what are your timelines what are your
deliverables what are your milestones
for the business remember I haven't said
HR yet right and then your job our job
is to translate how do humans pull that
off right so what you need to think
about before you start thinking about
what kind of degree or skills and
experience does it take to fill this
open position is what do people actually
do so I grew up in Silicon Valley and I
grew up in technology and very often
when I interview HR people I ask them
you know what is your business do
oh we were a bunch of engineers and we
make software and I say have you ever
sat next to an engineer while they write
code oh well no no I'm not technical do
you know what motivates them do you know
what drives them do you know what that
is do you know that they make pictures
and websites and interactive things out
of numbers zeros and ones it's crazy
stuff right it's like writing music when
they write code do you know that you sit
next to people do you know what they
actually do a very important part of
creating great talented organization is
to understand the timeframes of your
business so I got asked this morning how
do you feel about career development if
you have a team or a group of people who
you think are really great and but they
could be better and how do you how much
do you invest in career development or
training and I said it depends
completely on the timeframe if you need
somebody to know something that they
don't know over a period of years that's
a great investment if you need somebody
to know something that they don't know
or have no experience in in another
three months that's a tough one to do so
timeframe is important you need to work
come into work every
and look around the people that you work
with and say what slows them down
because I spend a lot of time with
forward-thinking startups and I spend a
lot of time with people who are
inventing the new world and here's what
I know for sure the new world has that
the old world doesn't speed right and so
if our job is to create processes and
policies that stop people from doing the
work that they do that matters we are
responsible for slowing our business
down so think about that
and then you know what's optimal
operation a lot of times we're being
asked to figure out or coach people
around organizational design and so we
pull out all these templates that we
have in our head without beginning with
the end in mind which is if it was
amazing if this if your team if your
company if your department was amazing
what would it look like so that's why
you think optimal not just better you
have to be a business leader first and
that's the thing that I think when I
talk to HR teams is the most significant
mindset change that is the most
empowering and the funnest part about
being HR person in the future you're a
part of the business you're a leader
you're not a facilitator for other
leaders you're one that demonstrates
leadership every day and people will
emulate your behavior because you're
really good at it
so sometimes we say oh well you know I'm
kind of the coach behind the scenes it's
not really my job but it's not true and
it's a lot more fun when you get to be
the leader so I want to talk to you a
little bit about invention because
that's where I grew up and I think
sometimes we think of ourselves as
implementers but I want to tell you some
stories about inventors because I got to
be around them I want to tell you the
story about the iPad at Netflix so Reed
Hastings who's the CEO that I worked
with it came to us in I don't know 2008
whenever the iPad came out and he said
hey guess who called me this morning
we're like
Oh God who calls you read he's like
Steve Jobs or like cool that's pretty
impressive what did Steve have to say he
said well Steve is inventing this new
device and we all knew that some kind of
tablet was coming out of my Apple
because they had invented the iPhone and
we knew that the next device was going
to be a tablet and he said we're like oh
really what did Steve say about the new
device and he said well he wants us to
be on it because he thinks that video
streaming is going to be a really
important part of the new device and he
wants us to be a part of it we're like
oh right we're gonna be the first apps I
mean this new device it's really cool he
goes yeah and they need it in 90 days
and we're like I'm like okay you know so
these five things that are really
critically important to the business
we're not going to do any of those we're
not gonna do one of them we're gonna put
the iPad in front of it or the device
and let me say the device he's like you
know we still have to do all this things
like well do we know what the technology
stack is know do we know what the actual
due date is it's Apple they're secretive
about it right oh and by the way only
five people in the company are allowed
to go to Apple to be let into the secret
room and behold what we are now to refer
to as the transformational device I'm
serious right so I go back to my
engineering team I'm like okay guys you
know what about this what about this
what about this it's as far as I'm
concerned it's impossible right they're
like they get this a gleam in their eyes
that engineers get when you tell them
they can't do something right okay okay
I'll get at the midnight oil right so
this team of people works night and day
for 90 days and we deliver that iPad app
and we're all crowded around the laptop
when he announces it at Macworld and the
first thing he demonstrates his Netflix
on the iPad right oh my god so
fast-forward I don't know a couple of
months and I walk into the engineering
meeting and I'm doing what I do when I
get really excited about stuff I'm like
oh my god the iPad is really a
transformational device I have any touch
touches most amazing technology it's so
primal like last night it was a
restaurant
and a two-year-old was like streaming
spongebob from there I chair I mean get
out right and my mom is binge watching
Meerkat Manor cuz she's sick
you know my mom couldn't figure out how
to use the auto teller but she can use
the iPad right and so I said I can't
imagine what its gonna be like on the
day I walk into my media room and I
swipe my wall and immediately they start
doing this oh man we're not gonna get
make you get up no you're gonna walk in
you're gonna sit on your couch somebody
else goes you're gonna have your
smartphone oh yeah and your smartphone's
gonna have like an app on it that's like
a mudo meter and you can put your thumb
on it it's gonna go all Patti or said
you need a comedy and then automatically
a comedy is gonna a romantic comedies
gonna start streaming with all my
favorite actors and I'm like and I
realized I was in the room with people
who could do that right they could do
that I mean it made me have the chills
and I was already pretty far along in
the radical stuff that I was doing in HR
by then right I had gotten rid of time
off I'd gotten rid of expense policies I
changed the performance review process
but just being around them inspired me
to think they never said let's take
regular television and see if we can
make it just a smidge better right they
imagined that experience and one of
these days when you guys go into your
media room and you're holding your
device with your mudo meter don't you
remember I told you and I probably know
the person that invented it so we can do
this to aim at inventors imagine what
will be and then they go there they
don't copy everyone else inventors don't
have the term best practices right so
I'm going to talk a little bit about HR
terms that I've learned to loathe so
don't don't hate me right and it doesn't
mean I'm picking on you it just means
some of these things make me crazy
okay best practices based on what right
some something somebody did ten years
ago that seemed to work for them that we
all do now like we all have different
come
but it's the best practice because we
practice it a lot so it must be best
engineers inventors innovators they
solve for a better way right they don't
solve for consistency
my daughter's a baker consistency is
really important when you're making cake
batter it's pretty much it right the the
dictionary term for consistency is the
same so just because you have
consistency does not mean you have
optimal process it just means that
everybody does it the same way and if
that's important to you I'm not knocking
that but you want to step back and go is
being is having consistency a goal worth
achieving because it might just mean
doing things the same inventors look to
the future right they don't have that
rearview mirror they say what can be
what can we be how can we think about it
inventors fail sometimes right we are
conditioned to be afraid of failure
compliance does not have failure in it
now I'm not saying that you know I'm not
encouraging anybody to break the law for
God's sake
but compliance for compliance sake might
mean that you're not willing to try
something new and be afraid and you're
afraid to try something and fail and
lastly I want to talk about the HR term
that I really like the least it's very
popular when you've all said it it's
called empowerment we're going to
empower our employees it's sort of
premised a like we have but we're the HR
fairies you're empowered
how do you feel about that huh huh
because I have empowered you the truth
is we all have power every single person
who comes to work every single day walks
in the door with power and we can take
it away but we can't give it to them
right and so I think that we've created
this term called empowerment which
somehow means we're going to give it to
them and I think that you know maybe if
we just thought about that differently
what if we took away all this stuff that
takes away their power
it's crazy idea huh but you know those
are the things that I kind of lay out
why at night and think about so I want
to talk to you about some practically
speaking you know some tips for you from
the stuff that I tried and learned I
want to tell you that the Netflix Way is
not a religion I do believe that the
word cult is in culture just so you know
so I'm I'm okay with that but I want to
just share with you some stuff that I've
tried and it doesn't mean that I'm
saying everybody should go implement all
these things all of the time but I want
you to just think about them a little
differently the first thing I talked to
all my companies about is what I call
the heartbeat of communication and that
is if you start with how I started with
your business person to begin with and
you understand what the business
objectives are that's called the context
of how people work how do you make sure
that people get information about how
their business works like the beating of
a heart
do you have quarterly meetings you have
monthly meetings you have weekly
meetings do you have one-on-ones do you
have team meetings do you have
department meetings are the objectives
of those meetings clear do I know that
every quarter I'm going to be in a
meeting with my department head who's
going to talk to me about the metrics of
our organization and if we've achieved
them and what we need to do to
accomplish that and I think one of the
most important things we can do in HR is
recognize what the heartbeat is and also
recognize when it needs to change so as
organizations grow as you become global
as it becomes complex the way you
communicate is going to have to change
that's another thing I think we can
embrace really well which is change we
all talk about change you change manage
like you can manage it right stuff
happens then you react to it so what we
can do is say when change happens have
we changed the way we communicate with
people so that they stay informed
when radical change happens the
heartbeat the heart beats faster right
if you if you think about that because
you're kind of racing to get something
done so that's okay you may want to over
communicate which just means communicate
faster
I think the gifts that we can give our
future employees is to teach them how
business works I would like every
employee in every company to be a mini
MBA I want people to know the difference
between profit and revenue
I interviewed somebody one time in the
last combo she's like ok ok I got it
ok ok wait it's a good question so so
like um you can have revenue without
profit but not profit without revenue
like this is a very senior level person
right so if we teach our employees how
to read a P&L then you know where you
fit in the organization right are you
there to save money are you there to
grow customers are you what's your
purpose in there and how do you measure
it that's all within the teaching of the
business staffing and recruitment I
think are the muscle of organizations
this is what I call talent management
that and and here's how I think about it
this is the lesson that I teach
everybody it's in the article I wrote
but I'll talk to you about it to begin
with the end of mine imagine that your
team is amazing in six months you can
see out there and you've got this team
and it's just oh my god everybody's like
holy moley those guys are accomplishing
amazing amounts of stuff ok what does
that look like what are the metrics and
what are people doing make a movie of it
have two microphones have you know
whatever and I'm following people around
the company what are they doing how are
they communicating what are they
operating then you drop down and you go
wow what would people need to know how
to do in order to accomplish that right
in order to make that happen in order to
then you drop down and say what kind of
skills and experience would it take for
someone to know how to do that in order
to accomplish that so that we can
achieve that and then and only then who
do you got and you hire for the deltas
right and you hire for what you're going
to achieve not more so sometimes I think
we look at recruitment as filling
tickets right we've got we have got an
engineering problem and we're gonna have
to solve it because we need to do more
engineering so let's go get some more
engineers let's go get some more the
kind we have then we'll have more
engineers and we'll do more engineering
stuff right
we'll have them have a degree from the
school with four years of experience and
let understand these kind of five
programming languages and that's our job
in HR that's all we're supposed to do is
fill the tickets and see what I'm saying
about context if you understand what
those people need to achieve then you
really understand what it is that you're
going to need to recruit for and the
recruiting team should be partners to
the hiring managers to make sure that
they build great teams that do great
work oh there's a concept what if the
job of management the only job of
management was to build great teams that
accomplish great stuff that is measured
that isn't relevant to the business okay
you might think about how management
operates differently in that way so what
if an employee who had been around for a
really long time that you really loved a
lot got another job at another company
that was a better job than you could
offer them what should you do you're
losing this loyal employee well you
would step back and say is that employee
really necessary to achieve what we need
to achieve are they getting an are they
getting an opportunity to do something
that we can't offer them the right thing
to do might be to let them go and the
right thing to do wouldn't might be to
manage that transition really well but
the other right thing to do would be to
have a plan for having a network of
amazing talent that you can tap when you
need when you need to
so if managers own building great teams
they own recruiting too as partners to
you my startups when I coach them I'm
like hello executive team hello CEOs I'd
like each of you to have 500 LinkedIn
connections they're like well we're busy
being CEOs I'm like yeah so and I don't
know 500 people like yeah you do you
know 50 and the Aged know 50 you're done
right
so social networking has changed the way
we recruit significantly and if you're
not deeply into understanding how that
works then start practicing right now
all of you can connect to me on LinkedIn
I have 500 connections but that's you
know it meetings like this are really
important because you meet other people
who have talent you want to be looking
for it we called it at Netflix my
recruiting team we call today be Yaron
that's always be recruiting you should
be recruiting in the bar you know in the
your kids sports teams meetings you know
you should be you should have an
understanding of what talented people
are and where they live all the time
that's a really really important job of
our function and let's talk for a second
about feedback I want to talk to you
about another thing that I'm not a big
fan of the annual performance review
okay I had a call from a bank a very
large bank and descent in the u.s. they
kept bugging me and bugging me what we
want you to come work with us ago and
should come work with it something like
I don't wanna work with you you're a
bank it's boring so I finally got the
guy on the phone and I said what is it
that you want to do he's like well I'd
like to institute a global human capital
management initiative I'm like what it
was
he's like well I want to change the way
we do performance reviews to make them
more efficient now this is a large
company hundred fifty thousand people
globally I said oh what business
objective are you trying to achieve with
your annual performance review he's like
excuse me like what business objective
does it achieve and he's like it'll
reduce turnover and a cream
employee effectiveness I'm like that's
not a business objective right he goes
what kind of you're talking about in
like revenue profit cost those guys
things like well you know I think it'll
decrease the turnover because people get
better feedback I'm like really didn't
you just lay off ten thousand people so
about that you know
retention thing how's that working for
you and I said how long do you think it
takes your company to go through your
global corporate annual feedback
initiative a month you know make your
company more efficient have you ever
considered throwing it away
he's like I'm hanging up now you're
crazy there's no evidence that the
annual performance feedback increases
people's performance everybody hates it
you hate administering it managers hate
doing it employees hate getting it right
so that it's an example of how should
you rethink a process like that so I
believe in feedback I love feedback
I love discipline and I love structure I
love them I hate policies and I hate
bureaucracy and they're very different
things right so I think feedback is
really important I think it's really
great for you to get feedback on how
well you're doing I think it should
happen regularly I think it should
happen probably every four to six weeks
I think it should happen between you and
your manager and I think you should give
it back to you in your manager if we had
that discipline if we insisted that
everybody got a one-on-one on a regular
basis with their manager and they talked
about feedback you know it would be not
so damn scary you know I could say you
know you kind of screwed that up and
you'd be like yeah when you're supposed
to help me out with it like I asked good
point okay so let's try it this
differently so I don't so I don't end up
saying at the end of the year has
difficulty communicating with management
regarding cross-functional team
initiatives and you don't know what I'm
talking about
so that's an example of something I
think that we could do better in
differently and then like I talked about
earlier
sometimes the goodbye is another hello
and we shouldn't be so afraid of a
goodbye discipline versus policies
here's here's a sort of a checklist for
you if you want to take a look at
whether or not your policies are
effective or whether they're good
discipline do you know what the results
are and does it achieve it does your
performance review process increase and
make better performance just ask right
you all you have to do is ask you don't
have do anything about it but it's a
good thing to think about does it
support business outcomes right you've
already heard me say that are they are
they making life better or getting in
the way really stop and think about the
work that we have people do does it
really move the business forward or does
it slow the business down because if it
slows the business down then you're part
of the problem not part of the solution
is it logical you know one of the best
feedback I ever got was I was talking
about doing a post-mortem on a
performance review process and one of
the engineers said why do you do this
and I started speaking fluent hrs
because I could speak it then well
Stanley that's a great question you know
it's a way for employees to give their
managers feedback in the process enables
you to achieve your corporate goals by
making a line a direct line between your
performance and the achievement of it he
goes that I don't stop it's just a way
to figure out how to pay us right I'm
like yeah he goes actually I thought the
process was ok I just don't like all
this yes that you talk about it you know
I'm okay that you have a process to
figure out how to pay me I'm ok with
that just say that's what you're doing
right don't say it's something else is
it logical and then I want to leave you
with this I want you to own it I want
you to own the whole thing I want you to
be business partners I want you to think
about the whole thing collectively you
don't own the little piece of it you can
own the whole thing in your company if
you want you can test it everything
doesn't have to be a global corporate
initiative you can have some little team
that wants to do something differently
and let him do it and talk about it and
try it and you know what else when you
do that you can also think about
throwing something away
right the bravest thing that we might do
is just stop doing stuff that doesn't
matter because you can always go back
you've got best practices you know if
you want to know the way that you used
you already know the way you used to do
it you can go back right you can reverse
engineer it or you could start new right
one of the ways you could do it is just
start new so I'll leave you with my
final thought I am pretty well known as
a radical HR person but it might just be
that I'm reasonable so that's my time
you

Patty McCord - Innovation, Talent, Teamwork and Transformation in Technology
[Music]
hi guys what a great spot you know I get
to I'm not gonna look at any of you
because I got that out here I wanted to
start by saying that I really am one of
you at heart but I kind of gave up being
one of you a number of years ago I
really am a professional HR person I
worked at very large companies I worked
at medium companies I worked at small
companies and startups was kind of where
I found my little niche I started out in
recruiting and that's important to
remember because I think recruiting
gives you a different perspective in
recruiting you know that every person is
replaceable and that there's always
somebody great out there and you know
how to measure your outcome you talk to
this many people you did this many
interviews you made this many offers
love that stuff which is why I love
coming after Google geeks because then I
don't have to talk about data okay this
is the buzzword of the day isn't it I've
been here for a couple of hours and I
think people have said this a million
times so I'm going to relate it to you
in terms of when I began my evolution
from being a professional HR person to
becoming what I often described as at
Netflix I was the CEO of the culture or
I was the product manager for people
right so I stopped being that kind of
business partner and became part of the
business and I remember the day it
happened the day had happened was in
October of 2001 and that was the first
sub Netflix was in business by 2001
since 1997 most people don't know that
and the reason I remember that
particular day in 2001 was that was the
day we were completely flat broke and I
laid off a third of the company so who's
done a layoff in here yeah that's what
I'm talking about we know what that's
about and I decided on that day after
those those folks left that contributed
a lot and that we loved a lot that I was
going to stop telling
the myths in HR that we say all the time
we are not your family
anybody ever laid off a family member
you have whoa dude
we'll talk later because I may need to
know that but I mean so we you we use
these words and I'm gonna talk about
that a lot in my talk today we've
developed a language in our function
that doesn't make sense to a lot of
people and the first one is the language
of team not family and here's what I
mean
Prasad said you know the sports team
metaphor doesn't stretch completely but
it works a lot right and the thing about
team and the thing about how we approach
what we do in HR you know we went
through this whole period where our
function was to protect our companies
from our evil employees and I often tell
people when they worry about any like
you know my general counsel says that's
illegal right and I'm like okay we'll
have your general counsel give you a
copy of the statute or the law that says
what you're proposing is illegal right
and almost never is that true it's that
you might get sued so I say when you
come to work in the morning however you
come to come on barred if you are in New
York and you take the subway or you
steps to get out of your car in your
Silicon Valley parking lot you look
around at all those cars say to yourself
they're all walking into sue me today
not and furthermore even if they were
with why do people sue other people sue
companies you guys know what's the
answer they're pissed right they feel
like somebody treated them wrong so I
often say the way to avoid having your
employees sue you is don't screw them
and that would probably work
my experience is that everybody comes to
work pretty much every day wanting to do
a great job and go home and feel like
they accomplished something
with other smart people and that they're
fully formed trustworthy adults and I
mean everybody I don't think there's
this hierarchy that like the the IQ
level goes from the sea level to the
part-time worker and drops significantly
and about the adult part you know I
remember one time my CFO said to be in
Netflix hey by the way I just thought
I'd give you a heads up we're gonna have
the people that work in the hubs in our
distribution centers and really have
everybody do direct deposit that'd be a
lot easier for us in finance so I'm like
really
would that be easier for you and finance
whoo that's what I'm here to serve
they don't have bank accounts he's like
who doesn't have a bank account well you
know they take their check and they go
by to cash it and they pay rent and car
payment gets you know it's not how it
works
he's like oh I forgot they're not
sophisticated enough I'm like no the
issue is that you're not sophisticated
enough to understand the spectrum of our
employees
and the thing about teams as they focus
on results right and they focus on
performance and I think that that's
really all that matters and I think
that's where we add a ton of value in
terms of how we operate with companies
but in order for us to do that we have
to determine what high performance is
and I'll talk a little bit about that
and I've removed a couple of words from
my vocabulary completely and I'll talk
about them as we go along but I invite
you to do so - one of them is policy and
the other one is procedural but I love
discipline you know I love I love geeks
I love engineers I've been in the valley
for longer than some of you have been
alive and I die you know here's why I
love them their world is black or white
it's good or bad it's right or wrong
it's zero or one and engineers are very
very disciplined and so when engineers
complain about a process that you're
trying to implement rolling out
initiating and they and they start to
whine about it you want to really get
under what it is that's bothering them
because they hate senseless bureaucracy
and stupid process but they don't mind
discipline at all I mean writing code is
in languages that have rules so I want
to tell you a story about a month ago I
got the opportunity to speak at the Bell
Centre in Montreal Canada does anybody
know what happens at the Bell Centre in
Montreal
it's where the Stanley Cup is played
it's a hockey turn hockey arena and I
didn't really know that much about it
and I was gonna do a keynote talk like
here but instead they said hey we're
gonna change it up we want you to talk
about team work and we want you to talk
with this guy Stanley Bowman Stanley
Bowman is the most winning National
Hockey League coach ever so I'm down
below I'm down getting ready to do to go
on stage with Stanley who's like you
know 70 something years old needs a
lovely man and we're talking about his
grandkids
and golf and you know and he he kind of
taps you on the shoulder he goes it's
like oh that's kind of cool so then we
go up to the stadium like up these
stairs three spotlights my face is on
the jumbotron there's 5,000 people out
there and everybody's like oh petit
McCord nice nice nice I'm like wow what
a great reception and Stanley walks up
and people like whoa you know standing
ovations like I'm on stage with Stan
Bowman people are like trying to do
selfies like so he'll be in the
background because he's that cool
so the moderator says mr. Bowman you
know you've had the winningest teams
over and over again you've played with
some of the best players in the league
how do you do it and he said well we
play an 80 game season and every 10
games I sit down with each player and I
run the statistics on how they're doing
they do a self evaluation I do an
evaluation of them I ask the other
coaches for input and often other
members of the team and we put together
a plan to figure out what we're going to
do with each individual for the next ten
games and so the moderator says to me
you know you have a reputation for
really hating the annual performance
review but I haven't heard you say hey
what it is you would do instead and I
said what he said and then I went to
Ireland from Montreal and I got to be
again the team thing it's like you're
gonna see these people talk all the time
the guy who is the winningest coach of
the Irish games so do you know this that
the Irish have like their own set of
sports that nobody else in the world
plays it's and they got all these names
things hurling it's kind of like hi Ally
but with hard stick I mean it's weird
right
and he says sort of the same kind of
thing in Aces High you know but I what I
look for in the team the real guys that
are really great they have spirit so
that's the other thing I learned it from
the real team guys about team so you got
a play to win right so that's the deal
about teams but in order to create great
team
you know Prasad talked about this
earlier you have to have great talent
and some people ask me you know you you
at Netflix you always hired a players
where did you get them I'm like well
there's an island that only some of us
know about and all the a players are
there we keep it very very secret and
the issue about talent is not a
particular it's about the combination
it's about the fit so because I worked
with engineers my entire life I came up
with an algorithm and you know what
algorithms are they're mathematical
formulas that I have to be true and this
is my algorithm for success you can use
it for your success yourself and you can
use it for anybody to hire that you hire
is what this person loves to do that
they're extraordinarily good at doing
something we need someone to be great at
and you know when you got the employee
that was really great and then is
walking around like whining all the time
I had this French guy one time he's like
we were it was at the beginning of
Facebook and he decided that social
networking was really important part of
the Netflix product and he wanted to be
on the platform and he wanted it now he
made this big speech at one of our
meetings and we said you know gosh we
got it we're gonna prioritize to like
five things that we can accomplish this
year and we're not going to do that but
he wouldn't stop right so finally I mean
I could hear I walked by an immediate
he's like doing the French thing you
know with his hands so I bring him in
and I'm like Jacques what the hell right
knee goes with it do you know how you
feel about Facebook I'm like we all know
how you feel about Facebook okay but
you're on search he's like yes I know
but and I'm like go to Facebook okay
they'll take you in a hot minute you're
a brilliant engineer and I'll miss you
terribly but I kind of need the guy
that's running search for us to kind of
be into search call me crazy you know
and and don't don't leave me stranded
right but you know you and by the way if
I remember interviewing you and looking
at your career your resume don't you
turn into a pumpkin every three or four
years
because you guys want to work on the new
new thing we're on your for so Reed
Hastings he's like did you talk to Jack
I'm like yeah yes did you tell him to
leave I'm like yeah and he goes why do
the hell did you do that he's a
brilliant guy and I'm like cuz it's the
right thing for the company the right
thing for the company is to have a
brilliant person in the job who wants to
do that job so here's a couple of other
things about people who are misfits for
their job if you hire somebody that
turns out to be technically incompetent
they're completely faultless in that
scenario you hire them right so that's
when that happens you want to go right
back to that interview process and say
how did we miss these technical skills
right what do we like somebody more than
they could actually do we not know what
success looked like and that happens too
especially if you're in a fast-growing
start-up you're like I need to get this
 done and this person who seems to
know like it and so I guess they can and
it turns out that they can't and my
experience is that almost always when
things don't work out it's because the
business shifts and that person's skills
are different than the skills that you
need going forward and any of you who
want to talk to me about the good
goodbye I you know we're talking
backstage about firing you know weapons
are not involved you guys go home I
gotta go fire somebody you gotta better
get that pistol out right that's not
what happens and so if you have context
around your business in you really know
what teams are trying to accomplish so a
lot of people have talked about this
this morning you have your goals you
have your objectives you know what
you're gonna do then you work backwards
from those goals and objectives and a
timeframe
oh let's see if that happens and what's
going to be different then that then is
now and then what is it going to look
like are there more meetings or less
meetings is there more conflict is there
less conflict what's going on how would
this team work then you drop down and go
okay I got that and I've got my numerals
I've got my metrics what would people
need to know how to do in order to
accomplish that oh well they might need
to
work very well cross-functionally they
might need to work externally they might
need all kinds of stuff right then you
drop down and go huh what kind of skills
and experience would it take for
somebody to know how to do that in order
to accomplish that by that time frame
and then and only then who do you got
and those create the conversations
around the deltas I love you wouldn't be
here without ya look you did an amazing
work I got to tell you for what we got
to do in the next six months if you
walked in the door I wouldn't hire you
it's not that I don't think you know
couldn't figure out how to do what it is
we need to do I just don't think you can
in six months because I'm kind of
looking for somebody with 13 years it's
not gonna happen in six months and
people can hear that right that's
reasonable that's logical and so the way
to create great teams from my
perspective is to make sure in all of
the communication that you have around
teams you include the following things
clarity clarity clarity clarity clarity
you know if somebody says here's the
goal here's the overarching goals and
objectives for my team's accomplishments
call your mom and if she doesn't
understand then it wasn't clear okay
honesty like that part about that person
I was telling you about if the business
shifts and there's not a place for them
tell them there's not a place for them
and figure out how to make that work the
other thing is if your company is
amazing and you accomplish amazing
things you're gonna be a great place to
be from what a concept
right and if you create if that's your
job as professionals in the talent space
is to create opportunities for people to
do amazing work so they walk away better
equipped than when they walked in the
door then you're gonna think about it
differently right you're not going to
start with the individuals career
development you're going to start with
what the company is trying to accomplish
and work backwards to the individual so
reality bites sometimes and things
change and that's the other caution I
have for you you need to be the voice in
every single meeting before the meeting
closes to say okay hold on everything
not everybody do we make any decisions
here today and if we did how are we
going to communicate them and let's
practice before we walk out of the
meeting so that reality is the same for
everybody that you know the reality of
what people here in finance is
significantly different than what people
here in engineering partly it's because
how they parse it but sometimes it's
about just getting real about the
consistency of your the words that you
use on communication and then I
personally think that the most admired
trait in amazing people that I've ever
found is the is the ability to have
great judgement you know that's what
makes great leaders the people that make
the right call when times are hard so
now I want to talk about transforming
our function most of us in the room
okay there's a couple things we got to
stop doing there's a lot of things we
got to stop doing
but first I'm tell you another story so
I meant Netflix and we are Steve Jobs is
called read and they want Steve Jobs
wants us the streaming service to be
part of their what we are to refer to as
the transformational device that
transformational device you now know of
as the iPad but we were to say that word
because nobody knew that word and only
seven people from Netflix were allowed
in the secret area where the
transformational device was to be held
and of course we had all this other
stuff to do and then we had to pull out
a team to do it because of course
everybody wanted to be part of it and so
we rolled out and it was the first video
app on the iPad and it was great it was
great so I go right running into my
product meeting one day and I'm doing
what I do oh my god touch technology is
amazing it's it is transformational and
it's human it's like monkeys you know
that you're gonna swipe your finger and
make something work last I was at dinner
in the two-year-old next to me was like
streaming Sponge Bob in his highchair
you know I can't wait until I walk into
my my media room and I swipe the wall
and the
and a movie starts to play and and then
around the room the guys are like
riffing right there like a we won't make
you get up no somebody else is if you
put your phone and you'll touch it yeah
and the mudo meter will say oh are you
sad Pattie and all of a sudden you know
my favorite romantic comedy will start
playing and I looked around the room and
I thought wow they're gonna do that
someday I'm in the room with people who
could do that someday
god dammit why not me right why not me
how come I can't innovate right how come
we keep saying words like iteration
right and here's what innovators do they
start with the end game and they work
backwards they don't say well let's see
let's provide a streaming service on the
iPad wonder what best practices are in
this area because let's be real best
practices means what everybody else does
we don't measure it we don't know that
it's best but we use that term all the
time they don't say I know let's put
together a team of people and empower
them you know what they're gonna do
they're gonna put together a team of
people who have power right you know why
we have to go around empowering people
now cuz we took it all away
so yeah so I mean seriously when HR
speed comes bubbling out of your mouth I
want you to stop and say did I say
anything that means anything to anyone
other than another HR person seriously I
mean I do I occasionally I call my mom
right she's like honey that just sounds
stupid
I don't know what the hell you're
talking about and another one of those
plenty language things you and your
sister talked about so that's a business
thing okay so the other thing is that
when an innovator wants to create a new
product they think about what's that
product going to do and then they start
making mistakes right and you know what
happens when something doesn't work what
are they doing it doesn't work annual
performance reviews don't work stop it
throw it away right we layer initiative
on top of initiative on top of
initiative I was telling somebody this
morning I ran diversity programs at Sun
Microsystems in the 90s I rolled out
global diversity initiative so we
celebrated each other
I spent $100,000 on this think Oh DeMayo
celebration we had tents I posters we
spoke at events and guess what happened
nothing I am so angry that the data is
so bad I'm so angry about it so don't go
do that okay first thing I want you do
once you go back and fix pay equality
let's write a check okay what are the
three departments had the most women in
them in any company marketing PR HR and
Finance we own two of them
seriously you know how did Facebook and
at you know Facebook announced yesterday
that they made it right you know how
they made it right they threw money at
it throw some money really save the
hundred thousand dollars on the Cinco de
Mayo festival and maybe I so I talked to
this other guy that the CEO forum and he
goes well oh boy and my lawyers are
gonna go crazy when they when I tell
them what you said for me to do it I'm
like why and they're like well you can
imagine what's gonna happen if I go and
do it you said I'm like what you go
I'm like they're gonna women are gonna
sue you and he goes yeah you know they
are why cuz they're gonna realize I've
been wrong and I'm like you are wrong
and they know it
so when we say best practices really is
it really best practices fix this stuff
we own we own talent we own what great
teams look like we own teaching everyone
in our companies how to read a piano one
of the best ways for people to
understand where they belong where they
fit in a company is too costly to go
through the math of the profit loss
statement oh yeah I did a really young
startup in on brown and Street the other
day and one of them says we're talking
have any questions for me and this kid
says and I'm you know he's 20-something
so he says yeah how do you feel about
departmental kegerators
[Laughter]
like you know I drove a long way to be
here with you today and we didn't call
them kegerators in my day but you know
there were kegs so what what are you
talking about and he said well you know
in the fight for talent company down the
street they got a kegerator on every
floor so and you know this company
haven't have swings and hammocks I'm
like - you don't isn't just one swinging
device enough / and like can you get you
got hammocks in the lobby what happens
when your customers come all our
employees are napping is one which i
think is probably okay but in the lobby
would you nap in your Lobby in a hammock
it's just weird some stuff we do is just
I mean what if it's feels weird it's
weird okay just like let's use some
common sense here people right so I said
to him I said you know first of all your
customer you don't have any internal
customers your customer doesn't work
here and your customer gives you money
for this service that you provide
that's called revenue then you take that
revenue and you spend it on things like
your salaries and the hammocks and the
swings and however many kegerators you
feel like you need to have and that's
the cost of doing business right and
what's left over is profit oh you guys
don't have any
so those of us have been around through
the Silicon Valley tech cycles more than
once or even once know that we're at
another cycle again and that the best
companies and the best teams and the
best decisions actually don't happen
when things are good they happen when
you have horrible choices to make and
the reason why at Netflix when I stood
up in October 2001 said we're team not a
family was because I wanted to be clear
and the second thing that happened for
those of you who read the Netflix
culture deck was we were doing twice as
much work with 1/3 as many people and it
was more fun and that's when we wrote
the chapter called high performance and
we realized that that matching of people
the right people at the right time and
then we went public the next year yay
and I looked around and all those
fabulous people and a third of them
were wrong because they've never been in
a public company before and some
functions in your business need to
understand what being public is right
and then we had to talk about well what
about our transparency what about our
open communication what about talking
about the PNL every day and so what we
did at Netflix was that was different
was we wrote stuff down and we wrote
stuff down in plain English and that
created the culture deck that some of
you have seen that culture deck took 14
years to write I didn't write it
read didn't write it we did it as a
group collectively right millions not
millions hundreds of thousands of people
probably helped contribute to it and you
know what why we wrote it in PowerPoint
PowerPoint I wanted to change it we just
changed it and when I stood up and say
hey by the way you know I'm gonna get
rid of like paid time off policy and I'm
gonna get rid of the expense policy I'm
gonna get rid of the travel policy I'm
gonna take all those people who give you
permission and I'm going to teach them
how to report back to you and then I
want you to use good judgement about how
you spend their company's money right
and if it turns out to be a disaster
like the
I'll tell us it will then what go to
back and do what everybody else does
I'll be best practices so I want you to
go I have your homework when you go to
work tomorrow I want you to walk in at
everything that you do every single
thing that you do every initiative I
want you to say why why don't do this
what purpose are we trying to achieve
here and if I started with a blank slate
would I do this is that what I'd come up
with right and the other thing is be
willing just like any other innovator to
experiment a little bit I mess with it
if it doesn't work don't do it and you
don't everything we do doesn't have to
be a global corporate human resources
initiative
maybe stop saying initiative maybe stick
with like two syllable words for a week
and see if you can do it right and
become experts and advocates for the
things we do extraordinarily well the
talent in the Artic organization
recruiting is the muscle when I when I
talk to startups I tell my CEOs that's a
muscle of your organization that's how
you grow and that the job of recruiting
is the job of every manager in the
company and every employee
we're completely socially networked now
if you don't know who the right person
is to do that job somebody knows
somebody who knows I always tell people
when they're talking about interviewing
and their own careers I'm like it's not
what you know or who you know it's who
knows what you know and encourage people
to interview when I talk to women's
groups I'm like you want to know what
your market base pay is go interview and
they're like I'm like you're not
cheating on your husband remember
engagement doesn't include a ring in
this case right just do it
okay that's what I want you to do I want
you to just find a couple of things and
mess with them a little and the other
thing is use these groups use this venue
use this forum to talk to each other
about what you're doing pick a couple of
people that are like you I have a group
of people that I talk
in the Silicon Valley I mean in San
Francisco I call them my posse and
they'll like I'm thinking about a policy
that requires people to take time off
because nobody's taking vacation I'm
like again call your grandmother read
say that out loud it doesn't make any
sense
has anybody ever bonus to anybody for
taking a vacation like so that's my
presentation questions you can do this
what do you guys wouldn't talk about
nothing I've stunned you what am i doing
now my partner Mike says whatever the
hell she feels like doing I do kind of
three groups of things I consult our
advise startups startups that I like I
typically am I'm much more effective at
sort of mid-sized companies are ready
for step functional growth that are
going to make it I'm not very good with
the 30 people you know the CEO calls me
oh my god go screw it up for a couple
years call me back if you're still alive
you know and they'll say but if we had
you we wouldn't make those mistakes and
I'd be like yeah you what you put
wouldn't because I tell you how stupid
they are but you wouldn't learn anything
it's really really important that you
learn yourself like can you give me an
idea of what one of those might be I'm
like like you hired your sister's
boyfriend and he turned out to be kind
of an idiot so you got a fire and your
sisters not gonna be happy so go do a
couple of those so I do that and I
taught I speak a lot I say yes to you
know honestly with HR people it's
changed a lot since I've left Netflix
when I was at Netflix and I would talk
to HR groups people walked out they did
I mean they were like she's lying what
software do you use for your annual
performance review I'm like well I just
told you we don't do a no performance
three maybe I asked the question wrong
no no you didn't you didn't ask the
question wrong now so but now because
now I think we're all realizing we can
do this better
right and that weird that we're doing a
bunch of stuff that's not mattering to
our companies it doesn't feel good right
you want to see at the table earn it
be part of the business right be part of
your business that's what really matters
so I do that and then I do sort of like
I like the women the pay equality issue
I want that fix and I want it fixed now
so I'm mad hey you I have a question
about that actually yeah as a former
internal recruiter one of the things
I've experienced is when women ask for
more money there's a reaction by HR I
encourage candidates to ask for more
here's what I tell women how do I ask
for a raise I'm like what you gotta stop
binge watching Mad Men cuz that's not
how it works so here's what we have to
fix if you are I tell somewhat tell
women you go interview at a company and
they pay you 20% below what your market
value is and they have a six and a half
percent merit increased budget with a
bell curve distribution salary bands and
ranges and you are amazing and you get
12% cuz you're a high performer I only
sucked by 8% right the math doesn't work
if we don't true it up the math doesn't
work and then we got to stop and say hey
is our compensation systems protecting
what we've always done
are they really allowing us to pay
market and the reason why people are
talking about pay inequality right now
is because the markets typed I've seen
this before right now we're all
sensitive because we don't lose anybody
right because the demand is higher than
the supply guys it's really a lot like
real estate right it really is not every
job pays the same your salary bands can
change if there becomes a slight supply
to
and equation so I suggest that what you
do is look to your recruiters for
compensation I used to tell people I'm
like listen when the headhunter calls
before you say no thanks be sure you say
how much income tell me and I would send
people like a winner I'd go interview at
Google no I don't want to interview a
Google takes forever I'm like please I
know I want to know what they're paying
people in that position so so go back
again so go back and go wait a minute is
our system getting us the right people
and you've got to be the advocate for
the this other team I I did this talk at
the CIO group in Washington DC and at
the end I did my call for you know just
go half your HR people run a spreadsheet
it doesn't have to be complicated you
don't need a lot of data analysis give
me every job title average male salary
every feet average female salary if
there's a discrepancy fix it so
afterwards this guy says you know I'm a
senior executive vice president of at my
company where I'd been for 26 years and
I'm very successful I mean
congratulations and he says and the
reason I'm successful is because my
fortune 50 company is very fiscally
conservative and I'm really good at
saving the company money and getting
bargains and getting the best deal I'm
like that sounds like a great thing to
do and he said but if I hear you you're
saying if a woman comes in and she's
making 120 and a man's coming in he's
making 140 I should pay them both 160
I'm like that's that's what you pay the
man that's you should pay the woman
because well why would I do that
I'm gonna spend 37 thousand dollars of
my company's money that I don't need to
I said Oh John thank you for sharing
that that's very logical what are you
gonna tell your daughter when she comes
home and tells you that story and he
goes oh it'll be fixed by then
but be fixed by them
right so you we have to be the advocates
for that and we and the other thing is
forget AB forget all the passion I have
around just do the math like okay guess
what we're not gonna do the picnic we're
gonna true up salary how about that it's
the same amount of money I mean we we're
not screwing people in Silicon Valley in
tech I mean our discrepancies are very
low but the other thing I found a for
women in tech in particular particularly
for women in engineering jobs is that
they just can't catch up you know you
start out low and you can't and you know
when we'll start fixing things when
people and what I tell women is vote
with your feet don't wait for that
company to realize if they don't realize
it already then go to another company
that will it's your career
so I'll you know leave you with that too
I mean our relationship with people is a
50-50 relationship you don't own their
career they do right other question over
here hi Daddy Sharon Richmond hi nice to
see you long time it is yeah um I was
wondering if you would talk a little bit
about the way to think about
compensation when you're using okay ours
and we've talked today about how to make
sure you're decoupling and I know you
have some pretty interesting thoughts on
yeah I I'm not a big fan of I'm not a
big fan of bonuses and I'm not a big
because in my mind you expect high
performance from everybody and if
they're pursuing that couldn't make
their performance bonus do you ever not
pay a performance bonus oh yeah when you
fire them here's what you could do you
could just fire them and pay everybody
else their performance bonus as part of
their compensation right so I think okay
ours are really important but I measure
results rather than the goals partly
because that's partly because Netflix
was so dynamic but now that I'm out in
the big world
we're also dynamic so the the problem
for me with some of the bonus programs
tied to things like okay ours is the
administrative overhang is just not
worth it and I think that goal I think
it's really important to set clear goals
but I I'm sort of a believer in that's
at the local level that's at the team
level right and that whole rolling them
up rolling them down keeping the
software and tying to compensation and
you know and then you change it and we
got to Rica Munich ate it all and you
know with my startups I'm like seriously
just don't go there don't go there cuz
you're gonna spend now you're gonna
spend a third of your time just trying
to figure out if you're wrong were you
wrong why are you wrong instead of just
going look we're wrong let's do this so
that's what I think I think you know I
think that we have a tendency to over
complex things and because if you
believe in market-based pay like I do
then there's really not that much of a
correlation if you if you achieve your
ok hours you're gonna be worth more it's
hard because we don't have systems for
that right I mean I wish we'd throw away
a whole compensation system take all
those people and try and figure out how
to do market base pay it sits in your
staffing org right you have the data you
just don't keep track of it right and
and it's with each other we all do this
what are you paying us well we paying a
graphic artist these days because last
one I heard you know interviewed Wade
twice as much as the one before that's
like oh yeah you know pay attention to
the trends and what's happening we've
always been good at doing that it's my
time up here just one more question over
here yeah I wanted to get your
perspective on the cultural
transformation that happened between the
private and the public side of Netflix
and maybe any lessons learned or
insights you can share yeah you start
having to ask yourself a lot of
questions because you're pressured to
keep a lot more secrets and so there are
things that are associated with that so
for example we decided to keep the
trading window very very narrow because
we want
people to have access to a lot of
internal you know would be material
non-disclosure writing material
nonpublic information so we tried to
keep that window really small and that
was an experiment we tried and we
thought you know employees are gonna be
really upset we did crazy crazy stuff
with stock we granted stock options
monthly fully vested ten-year term
consider that right and and we allowed
people choice in terms of how much
equity how much salary they wanted it's
harder to do when you're a private
company because equity so much part of
the compensation system if you're a
start-up if you're a smaller company pre
public company you have three forms of
compensation at your fingertips you have
salary you have title and you have
equity and I tell very small startups to
bank one bank title because whoever you
call an executive vice president in the
first hundred people you are just wrong
you are right for one thing you don't
need an executive vice president for a
hundred people so you know keep it and
and you know here's how you know it's
time for some discipline instead of
instead of that sort of organic stuff
that happens to us off you know small
startup I call it the stand on the chair
model when I could no longer to talk
talk to everybody in the company by
yelling standing on a chair then I
needed some discipline and I think the
other thing is when you when you become
bigger you go public and you start to
become a more complex organization the
most important thing to constantly
revisit is your heartbeat of
communication right I could stand on a
chair spontaneously hey everybody get it
on the parking lot Peggy's gonna stand
on a chair and tell you something right
but then it was like you know now
Netflix has quarterly management reviews
that happen all over the world and
people fly out and do three-day business
seminar stuff right and that just wasn't
necessary to a small size but that's
when it starts you know this because
you're in the organization when you hear
your executive team make a statement
tell you how it is and then you're down
here and this like no that telephone tag
this person didn't hear what you said at
all so then a lot of times that's around
maybe we should meet more often maybe we
should meet less often
you know I consulted with a game company
in Norway and whenever I do the offsites
with the you know the smaller startups
the issue is always communication always
isn't the issue always communication I
mean really so why don't we own that
right so he says I don't understand why
they're so confused about what we're
doing we meet every Friday you know we
meet every Friday we talk about what
we're gonna do next week and then we
meet you know on Friday to see whether
or not we've done it and I'm like oh
well they know how to go they just don't
know where it's too granular right so
then everything is a report back meeting
instead I'm like they they're waiting
for you to tell them a bigger picture a
bigger story and he's like well I how do
I come up with a big story every week
I'm like when you don't do it every week
you do it maybe it's time for a monthly
meeting maybe it's time for a quarterly
meeting so pay attention to the the
heartbeat of your communication in your
company that we do really well right
that we're experts and advocates for
we're the ones that can go back to the
organization and say I mean I remember
read I'll leave you with this and how do
you I'm like things aren't going well
out there it's kind of funky right he's
like what's your data how many people
did you talk to it what exactly did they
say and in the early days I'd have to
say you know I asked the following 12
people the following six questions and
then over time he'd be like how's it
going out there I'm like yeah let me go
find out and the other thing is to
observe when things are great cuz you
see them and then dig in there right
that's why I'm saying you don't need HR
metrics you don't need them you know
when the CFO wants to close the books in
two weeks instead of three and they've
been working on it for six months and
that thing happens you go to finance
they're like oh that's the IT guys new
software it doesn't work you know the IT
guys say like oh that's finance people
they can't give us a good spec
and then you find out well actually the
people in finance who do data entry
don't want to use the new software it's
going to eliminate their job and so
they're gonna passively resist until
hell freezes over and half buzzy doc you
know fuzzy requirements that nobody can
make in there in a complete impasse and
it's never going to get together right
so that's a business problem there's a
business solution that you have to drive
not like they're unhappy and financed
and they're frustrated in IT Thanks

Patty McCord on How To Build A Culture of Freedom and Responsibility
[Music]
effective criticism is also really
positive if I can confront you in real
time and you can answer in real time I'm
teaching you how to do that that's Patty
mord former Chief Talent officer at
Netflix renowned Human Resources
consultant and the bests author of
powerful building a culture of freedom
and
responsibility that's the reason why
 doesn't get done nobody stands up
and says okay we all know this is
ridiculous so who has an idea about how
we could do this
[Music]
differently I'm Michael Mogul founder
and CEO of crisp the nation's number one
Law Firm Growth Company I've built my
business through practice not Theory
crisp starter which is $500 to my name
and has grown to over eight figures in
Revenue over the last few years earning
a spot on the Inc 500 list of the
fastest growing private companies in
America our approach has been to take
everything we've learned about
generating massive growth within our own
organization and help the country's most
ambitious and committed Law Firm owners
do the same for theirs in each episode
of this podcast I sit down with
Innovative Market leaders from the legal
industry and Beyond to learn from those
who thrive in the face of adversity
challenge the status quo and Define what
it means to be a true Game Changer I sat
down with Patty McCord to discuss the
role of constructive communication and
fostering Innovation and collaboration
why feedback is best delivered in real
time for Maximum Impact and how to
instill a sense of ownership in your
team where everyone takes responsibility
for their actions and contributions so
here's an example I think management
made a stupid decision they shouldn't
have done this so I say there's two
questions to ask the second one's most
important the first one is if you were
in management what decision would you
have made the second one is if you were
in management what information would you
want to have to make the right decision
that's coming up on the gamechanging

the fee so we can keep this podcast as

podcast thank you I'm glad to be here as
we were talking a little bit offline but
I'm excited to talk about the book and
we're going to get to that but before we
do I would love to know just what led
you down the path to HR Human Resources
working with people was it anything from
your childhood was it was anything that
influenced you I just in terms of career
path of choice oh I want to go back to
those deep dark secrets it's funny
because a couple of weeks ago uh I
reunited with my best friend from 3rd
through sixth grade we were out of touch
for 55 years and she went on to become
the co-anchor of the Dallas evening news
and so the reason I'm telling you this
is because when we got together it was
so fun like tell me about you in the 80s
tell me about you in the 90s like what
was it like to be the first Hispanic
woman and Southern Texas TV and her was
like what was it like to be you in Tech
in the 80s and 90s so I'll tell you my
tech story I started as a recruiter uh
because I knew how to do that from a
couple of other jobs I had and I was
pretty addicted to it I mean I really
loved um so I started out recruiting
technicians and assemblers for a disc
drive company here where I live and then
I started recruiting engineers and it
was mostly mechanical engineers at the
time
and I was obsessed with going and
hanging out with them like they were
doing a lot of Robotics at the time I
was like oh that's so cool that little
arm that does how do you think about
this so I became really obsessed with
the work that people do so when you're
an internal recruiter if you screw it up
and you have a shitty team you know and
they don't work out then you don't last
very long so it was about very very
early on in my career learning about
Talent and teams and what it took to
make something so I was really
interested in the the maker thing like
people who made stuff so that's how I
started and I was never a very good HR
person um so I went from my first
company was like a 100,000 people
globally that was Seagate then my next
company was uh Sun Microsystems in
the80s I ran diversity then and it was
80,000 people globally
really interesting times you know when
Cheryl sanberg wrote her book leanin
because I knew the data from the 80s
about women in technology I looked at
her data I was like it's
worse it oh my God you know we we didn't
go anywhere it's worse so then I did
that and then I did smaller company
smaller companies I always said you know
in the end I'll be on my own and that's
where I am right now and I am curious so
at believe um you joined Netflix this is
back in was it was it ' 98 97 oh 97 okay
what are the company look like
then was 30 people we had these piles of
DVDs in the lobby right so I shared a
room with a guy named Mitch low who was
one of the early Founders and we had to
tell each other you know I'm moving my
chair back you move your chair back we
had to do that Mitch owned a a video
retail store in mil Valley
and I would go to the front and I'm like
hey Mitch nerdy nuns dirty nuns is
in I think that was for it was crazy I
mean we we did due dates and late fees
and we just thought we'd be Blockbuster
online I guess on that note what was the
culture like and I believe you you
followed Reed um from the the past
company you guys were out
right yeah so I'll I'll tell you why I
ended up in that crazy little room with
mitcho reading I were together at a
company before that uh called Pure
software and we grew through merger and
acquisition every time we acquired
another company I would take their
handbook and our handbook and I'd smush
them together and I'd create more
policies because I was a agar
professional right and then we got
acquired by our largest competitor and
then Reed and I both left the company
and he made a bunch of money so he
invested in other startups and that's
how he invested in Netflix and so he
called me up in the middle of the night
this True Story 2 in the morning he says
are you sleeping and I'm like yeah geek
I'm normal it's 2:00 in the morning why
aren't you sleeping he says well I'm
going to go run Netflix with Mark Mark
Randolph was the co-founder at the time
and I said oh yeah sounds like a great
career move why are you telling me this
at two in the morning and he said I want
you to come too and I said no way I mean
this is the dest idea I've ever heard of
DVD in the mail I mean who are you going
to sell it to the three other people we
both know that have DVD players they
cost $800 back then right and he said
yeah but you know we could create the
company we always dreamed of and I
thought that's
compelling because I was Consulting at
the time and so that's why I joined
because we decided that we were going to
try and do something different
not just in terms of renting movies
renting movies online renting DVDs
online but creating a company that was
maybe different than the ones we thought
of before from what I've read it it
seems like you spent over a decade just
experimenting right just with new new
ways to work new approaches setting new
standards new Norms I I'd love to know
like what gave rise to that mentality
and then ultimately gave rise to the to
the culture
deck you know I'm known now for being
this crazy innovator
uh and as lawyers you'll all understand
that um you know you you always have in
HR people always have to work within the
confines and the parameters of the law
but what I did instead of creating crazy
new ways to work was I stopped doing
things that didn't make any difference
right I just stopped doing stupid stuff
I so an example is I thought about why
do people Sue companies right why do
people do that right it's because
they're pissed off because they feel
like they've been treated badly they've
been feel like they've been treated
wrongly they feel like nobody told them
the truth and they're surprised by what
happens to them and so they think this
isn't fair it's because I'm a woman it's
because I'm black it's because I'm his
whatever those reasons are the reasons
are because there's no real answer and
so what I decided to do was instead of
creating system and processes that prove
that you're incompetent over a 90-day
period so that I can fire you instead I
could reel it back and say what if I
told you the truth up front what if I
told you that this thing that we hired
you to do that you've worked really hard
on doing for the last four years you're
done and we don't need you to do it
again and that's the honest truth and we
want to respect you and we want you to
move forward and be
you know we want you to we want to build
a a company that's a great place to be
from and so for everybody for all the
lawyer litigation lawyers that are
listening to you today it's like what
have you created a great place to be
from then you wouldn't be angry you
wouldn't feel like you're played and you
would figure out okay well we move on I
did a I did a conference in Canada a
couple years ago with 500
CEOs and 500 CEOs in Canada and they all
brought their HR people and I said raise
your hand if you're in the job that you
had right after you graduated from
University how many hands would
up I said raise your hand if the most
important thing you think about uh HR
metrics is retention 500 hands went up
I'm like
really you know that's not true right
it's you know it's a lie what I've
decided to do and what I've made my
reputation on is telling people the
truth when it's real and to help them to
to have great opportunities at Great
companies and move through their careers
so that's the deal with that right it's
um about getting rid of systems and
processes that don't move the company
forward or make people successful
and realizing that your career is a
journey and you're not going to be in
the same place for the rest of your life
it's just not it hasn't been true since
I 1956 I don't know pick a date and a
few years ago uh You released an
incredible book so powerful building a
culture of freedom and responsibility so
for those that are listening to this
some I'm sure have read the book some
may now be ordering the book um what
motivated you to write it in the first
place well you know after I left Netflix
uh we had the culture de deck which a
lot of people have read inside scoop
that deck took us 10
years to write and every chapter is
built on the chapter before so when we
had like these are the behaviors that we
think are most important to rely on each
other for and then we said we're going
to have high performance employees and
then we're going to have freedom of
responsibility and then we're going to
have context not control all those
things build on each other so then when
I left Netflix everybody throw the deck
on the table and say we want to do that
and I was like well you know it's a big
deal it's a it's a lot of systems it's a
lot of getting rid of things that
everybody else does it's like rethinking
best practices I wrote the book honestly
to be the uh hitchhiker Guide to the
Netflix culture deck and I want to go
through it at least some of the some of
the highlights because I know early in
the book um you emphasize that great
teams are not created by incentives or
procedures or perks but rather by hiring
people who are adults and eager to tack
tackle challenges now two questions on
that one how do we Define
adults do you have any examples uh maybe
experience at Netflix or anywhere else
where this approach led to the formation
of a remarkable
team I think we go about it completely
backwards so here's my methodology if
you say in 6 months let's use that as a
time frame because we hardly ever use
time frames when we're talking about
people right in six months if this team
would was amazing and everything was
going extraordinarily well and you made
a movie of it what would be occurring
then that's not occurring now right
would there be more meetings would there
be less meetings would there be people
with heads down just working on code
would it be that people are cross
functionally communicating better would
it be that our brand is more important
what whatever it is what's that and then
you work backwards from there right okay
so if that's going to happen in six
months then we need somebody to be able
to do this they need to be able to do it
in that time frame then who do we have
and so what you hire for is the Delta
right somebody who has experience in
something we don't know how to do
somebody who has expertise in a
particular technology that we don't know
somebody who's curious about something
that we're taking for granted whatever
it is so that becomes that defining
clarification becomes your job
description not that they have 5 and A2
years of progressive experience managing
that they have the ability to solve that
problem in that time frame right and so
now you want to go into what would that
take and that's who you interview to
succeed in that job because what happens
really I mean this is my lifelong
experience is you say I want to hire
somebody who's really smart who's uh a
good decision maker somebody who's
thinks on their feet who's really great
at communicating I want to hire somebody
just like me and then you do and like
hires like hires like hires like and
then you wonder why nobody has a new
idea and so when you go back to say who
can solve this problem in this time
frame that's a really different
experience when you're interviewing
people it's a really different
experience in who you hire and very
often the person that you hire is going
to be not at all like the people that
you when you mentioned um hiring people
who are adults is that stem from a
certain level of emotional maturity or
is it relating to something
else it's both I mean it's emotional
maturity it's somebody who's willing to
take responsibility for the decisions
they've made right is somebody who's
willing to learn from their bad DEC
decisions do you remember I don't know
five or six years ago there was this
Google brew HaHa about this guy who
wrote this Treatise about women James
Dore he women couldn't be great software
engineers and I got a call from I don't
know USA Today or something they're like
and this is in the middle of like what
was Google going to do about it like
they're like would you have fired him
I'm like in a hot minute hopefully I
wouldn't have hired him cuz you know
he's a twit in the interview right who
which woman on the interview team said
oh he's a great guy we should absolutely
hire him it's about really thinking
about who's going to be great on the
team but it doesn't mean who you're
going to like it's going to mean who's
going to add something that you don't
have already it's like any other team
right if you have the right people in
the right place at the right time you're
going to win right and if you have
yesterday's people for tomorrow's
problem we can't always get there it's
not that they're bad people it's just
that they're the wrong people and I know
you also you stressed about the
importance of ensuring communication
flows up and down within an organization
what are some of the common barriers
just to to effective communication
within organizations what what do
leaders run into how can they overcome
this
stuff they listen to whiners without
expecting real answers so here's an
example I think management made a stupid
decision they shouldn't have done this
so I say there's two questions to ask
the second one's most important the
first one is if you in management what
decision would you have made the second
one is if you in management what
information would you want to have to
make the right decision right so it's
this constant pushing the organization
to say okay well think problem finders
are not very valuable problem resolvers
worth their weight and gold so so it's a
matter of teaching people that it's we
absolutely want to hear what you have to
say what do you think we should do
instead right it's just training people
to have respond with and here's my
thoughtful observation about what we
should do instead for those listening if
somebody's asking themselves well Patty
if I share all this information with my
organization I worry if some may either
misinterpret it or take it out of
context or that it could somehow
backfire I mean not not all people a
small handful perhaps what what would
you say to that I would say that's
probably pretty uh common in most
organizations but if you focus on the uh
resolution I'm going to share this
information but I'm going to tell you
what I think would we could do better
then over time you're going to have a
reputation as a problem solver not a
problem finder and the problem solvers
we
notice right I'm in I've been in a lot
of executive meetings about oh man
here's this terrible problem what are we
going to do about it who's going to lead
it what about Joe right he's
unfucked a bunch of stuff and so we
should throw him at this again right so
you develop a
reputation that leaders notice that
you're able to gather other people
around you and solve problems and or at
least attack problems right and not just
do that it's not my isue I would say
that it takes
bravery and but bravery is what makes
leaders on this note I you mentioned the
value of sharing criticism openly and
providing specific examples of
problematic behavior and solutions can
you share how leaders can effectively
deliver criticism in a constructive
manner that it really just they can
encourage more so growth than
defensiveness yeah I wish I had never
said radical honesty because I don't
think it's radical to be
honest right and so here's a couple of
notes I have around that first of all um
again uh if you're going to comment on
somebody's uh performance in the
negative first of all like as parents we
know how this um this works right it's
called shaming right that bad thing you
did that was bad thing if you do it
again you should feel bad and the next
time you do it you're going to feel bad
it's effective but it's kind of slow and
if I don't say that thing you did if you
did this instead it might be better then
that's help the other thing is effective
criticism is also really positive if I
say to you oh my god in this meeting you
finally spoke up and you shared your
solution and it was you've been telling
me about this for months thank you you
will do that again
today right so it's about feedback in
the moment it's about feedback with a
solution that thing you did that was
great do that again right that you that
you spoke up in a meeting and you said
this is important to me and here's what
I think we should do or you could have
done that so much better here's what you
could have done instead so it's about
effectivity not about um cruelty I guess
support what you said you also said to
do it in the moment or to do it soon
after whatever the behavior is that
occur as soon as you can as soon as you
can
let's take the you've been wanting to me
about some decision that we're going to
make and you've been wanting to me about
it for a long time we're in a meeting
we're about to talk about that decision
and we're making a decision and you
don't say anything I see you roll your
eyes right and then later I can say why
didn't you say anything right would be
better if in the meeting I said why
aren't you speaking up we've talked
about this before you have you have
disagreements with this Michael what
would you do differently what do you
think we should do here right if I can
confront you in real time and you can
answer in real time I'm teaching you how
to do that and P if there's somebody
listening to saying that but that goes
against everything I've learned about
leadership I thought it was praising
public and criticizing private what what
would you say to that it's really
ineffective it may be the way your
culture works at the company that you're
at or at the firm that you're at or
whatever that you're at but that's the
reason why doesn't get done because
nobody stands up and says okay we all
know this is ridiculous so who has an
idea about how we could do this
differently you know um I miss being
part of a company I do and here's what I
miss most I miss going into a meeting
where I'm absolutely sure I'm right
right I've studied it I've done the data
I'm all prepped to be right and rightous
and then I go into a meeting and then
I'm proven wrong and I love that I I
miss that I miss when people talk me out
of my stubborn decision because they
facts they data they their suggestions
are better than mine when I left Netflix
it was uh the time of another big Tech
bubble here in the Bay Area and I kept
meeting with all these people who were
the HR Chief happiness officers
right so I'm like what do you do right
so I'm talking to somebody about it I
said why do you have to make people
happy and she said well you know if we
don't they're going to walk out the door
they're going to turn right they're
going to go to the next company over has
better beer and they're going to leave
us for a better beer I'm like you know
if somebody leaves you for a better beer
then bubye right and find out when their
happy hour is and go to their happy hour
but I said to her I want you to find I
want everybody on the team to find three
people who made a difference right who
made a difference in this company and it
doesn't have to be by title people go oh
yeah you know Michael's really good
right and ask them to tell you about a
time when they felt like they made a
difference to the organization to the
customer to the company and every single
story will be about something hard so
when we go home at night and say it was
a great day at work we don't say the
beer was
amazing we say we did it that's what
teams do that's what work work is about
stuff we can't do anywhere else in our
lives being around other really smart
people and accomplishing something and
then when you do those accomplishments
you think what else can we do right I
mean it's just this Builds on this
success Builds on success I always tell
people in early stage startups that the
whiteboards aren't full of like
accomplishments the whiteboards are full
of like not that not but if you learn
from it then you grow from it and you
also mentioned that data should serve as
the basis for good questions I'd love
for you to elaborate on the difference
between being fact driven and data
driven and why both are
essential the reason I'm fact and data
driven is that it's the easiest metrics
of what's going right so when I talk to
HR teams they're like what HR metrics
are important I'm like the ones that are
on the pel so if you got a team that's
not committing but not delivering over
and over again quarter over quarter
something's wrong with the team it's the
wrong team it's the wrong Talent they're
committing to things they can't deliver
whatever it is right so it's always a
people problem underneath it but the
metrics are in the deliverables so it's
one of my favorite things about the
post-pandemic world I get asked to talk
a lot about the future of War it's here
we have to wait right the future work is
here and then the other one is um
whenever I talk to people before the
pandemic they would say oh we'd love to
do what you did at Netflix but we can't
cuz we're regulated be we can't because
the lawyers tell us we can't we can't
cuz we're International we can't cuz our
CFO we can't right we can't possibly
work from home 48 hours later we did
that muscle was always there it was
always there about the stuff that we can
do it's maybe the reason why you need
the space to do what we can do is to get
rid of the stuff that we don't need to
do and I want to go back to something
that P I knew you mentioned a little bit
earlier just asking your team members to
put themselves in a in the Founder's
shoes how can let's say more established
organizations and even their team
members adopt this entrepreneurial
mindset of just you of really asking
someone to put themselves in in those
shoes I've heard leaders do this sort of
thing and it hasn't been as you know as
received as well by their team members
um what what's a what's a way to bridge
the gap you know I think that's kind of
hokey to be honest with you you can't be
in a large company and put yourself in
the founder shoes there two different
pairs of shoes right one's a flip-flop
and one's a hiking boot I mean I don't
know what the metaphor is but it's two
different things instead of putting
yourself in the founder shoes putting
yourself in the leader shoes if I were a
decision maker how would I make this
decision right how do I think about
doing it that and you can do that at any
level you're at in any part of any
organization and if you teach yourself
how to think that
way then you would probably be a leader
because you don't have to to wait for
somebody else to think about it for you
the fter aren't always right I work with
so many early stage entrepreneurs and
some of the biggest things they do right
is the things they do
wrong right you know what I'm saying
like they do it wrong and they're like
that was stupid let's try not to do that
again it's more about learning from your
mistakes than being the no be all know
all person and there something you
mentioned earlier that stuck out to me
and even in the book that it seems very
contrarian so when you were speaking to
those HR professionals and I know you
mentioned that retention is seen as like
the metric that everybody wants to you
know have dialed in and yet you say it's
not a good metric of a great team um if
you could elaborate on that it's
terrible right here's Michael he's been
here seven years he hasn't done but
he is still here like what's the point
right you got always always always so my
definition of great management is a
great manager assembles an amazing team
who delivers high quality results for
their customers or consumers on time
with quality that's it but it's always
forward-looking
right it's always about what you do in
the future it's not about did you
perform well last year Well if you
performed well last year in something
that we don't need anybody to do well
next year then it doesn't really matter
and it's not you where I I'm not I'm not
criticizing you personally I'm just
saying wow it could be a whole different
skill set the Netflix example that I use
in my book is we realize we're going to
grow 30% quarter over a quarter three
quarters in a row right and we go to an
executive staff meeting I'm like what if
this keeps happening you know what
happen to our company our CFO goes to
the Whiteboard and he's doing Topline
Revenue right 30% growth quarter
record's
like oh my God it's so much money and
Ted sandis who's now co- CEO of Netflix
says you know at the time we would say
someday we'll be as big as
HBO someday and he looks at the numbers
he's like it's next year you guys like
we could be as impactful as HBO next
year we're all
like like we' never even thought of that
and our head of U product said you know
that's a third of the US internet
bandwidth so I'm like could you stay
after the meeting and we could talk I'm
like does anybody know how to do that
and he says no how is it technically
possible and he says well it's in the
cloud and there are people that know how
to do that more than we do but you maybe
it's Amazon maybe it's Microsoft I mean
I don't know but we was so we go back to
our it team who is absolutely fabulously
completely and totally managing our data
center for DVD by mail and they're
amazing brilliant incredible people and
we tell them what the problem is and
they're like no worries you guys go exec
something we'll build a cloud and I said
you know if anybody in the world could
do this it's probably you but not in
nine words it's not humanly we couldn't
buy the equipment right and so that led
to a discussion that was are we going to
miss this
opportunity because we don't have the
right team we can't that's a really
different way of thinking about teams in
the future and what you want to do and
how you want to scale because every
problem in the future is different than
the one in the past and that you know
proactive preparation seems like it's a
kind of a recurring theme um and and
also I'd love for you to speak to
because I know this has come up um a
little bit in some of some of the
responses you've given me around just
the value of having a highly effective
team player like just somebody who is
really really really good at what they
do versus somebody who's just mediocre
kind of a seat filler I'm a big believer
in you know the best person in every
seat I did a dinner with a bunch of
entrepreneurs and uh one of them said
you don't really mean that right you
don't really mean an player on every
seat and I said well in your company
what are you talking about right you you
must have experience with this he said
yeah but like you know you don't like
payroll right the person in payroll
doesn't have to be an a player really
you don't want the person that's in
charge of paying who you think are the a
players you to be really smart about
that and I said and by the way your
finance department hates you you don't
know my company you don't know anything
about us why are you saying that like
because you just told me a perfect
stranger that you think your payroll
person is an idiot you think they don't
know they know and so who knows what
they're doing behind your back right to
prove you're wrong or what my my point
is what we think as Leaders sometimes
are the important jobs that have to have
the a players in them is true but we
want people in every job to be really
passionate and good at what they do
because that's what makes us
effective and along with this it seems
like if you can foster a sense of
ownership or at least um just a level of
accountability that somebody can have uh
I'm curious as there if there's any
recommendations you'd make for leaders
that are listening to this on just ways
in which they can Empower their team
members to give them a sense of control
to give them a sense of confidence like
in in their roles
yeah so I'll I'll first speak to the
word you used empowerment um which is
why I named my book powerful because I
think the reason why we have to empower
everybody now is because we took it all
away and people come to work with power
and then we just slowly take it away
from them so I think the most important
thing you can do is teach everybody
literally everybody in your organization
how the business works right how to a
p&l this is not brain surgery here's
what comes in here's what we spend money
on here's what goes out here's you know
I remember in the first.com boom I I
interviewed somebody and I said
something like she goes okay okay okay
profit and revenue I'm like okay she's
like so you can't have profit without
Revenue the fundamentals of business we
should teach people very very early
early on in their career so they
understand what part they play in in the
whole thing you know it's um the
customer service rep who convinces uh a
customer to tell somebody else to join
the firm or join do whatever because
it's so great saves you marketing
dollars right I mean it's just that
straight up so teach people how it works
this you spend here's what you take
right everybody can figure that out and
Patty for someone who's listening to
this I'm sure and I strongly recommend
if they haven't to pick up your book but
if they could take away only one thing
from this conversation I don't know if
they'll get 100% of it but what do you
think that should
be just that we haven't figured it out
that the idea of best practices
typically just means what everybody else
is doing we don't have to wait for the
future of work it's now and so it's
perfectly okay to experiment to try I
mean everything I learned I learned from
engineers and product managers right
which is can we AB test it should we
rethink it if I started from scratch
would I do it the way I it's always been
done people ask me all the time now who
do you think is doing the best job at
remote work I'm like nobody we're all
just making it up so I mean maybe
someday somebody El but they want to
figured out for a law firm they want to
figured it out for public utility they
want every organization is different and
it's okay it's perfectly okay to be who
you are in the space that you're in just
to sneak another question because I'm
just I'm just curious um how do you
believe it's different to be a leader
today than maybe five or 10 years ago
right I guess just what what do you see
as the biggest
differences I think it's about context
right I mean I think it used to be
edicts that come from the top that you
the whole waterfall FY like oh we'll say
it from the top and it'll flow down and
everybody will understand it this it
just doesn't happen anymore partly
because it's not how we operate anymore
we're on social media we talk to each
other all the time we all opine about
what's going on so people are much much
more informed than they used to be where
they waited for leaders to tell them to
do I think that the best leaders are the
ones that really focus on context here's
what we're doing here's what it's about
here's what you know one of my favorite
Parts about working with Reed Hastings
was he would stand up and say I was
wrong here's the decision I made at the
time I made it here's the information I
had to make that decision I was wrong
and here's what I know now that I didn't
know then
that botling of like constantly
refreshing what we know what we're
learning what we know what we're
learning I think is really powerful in
organizations going forward and as we
come to a close this being the
gamechanging attorney podcast Patty what
does being a game changer mean to
you stop doing stupid
stuff it's that easy
honestly I want to give a huge thank you

How NETFLIX Created Their Culture
here's the backstory of the Netflix
culture dick tell us
so when Reid and I went to Netflix the
thing that we vowed to each other that
would be different was we would we would
actively control the culture as much as
we could we would be deliberate about it
we wouldn't let it happen and so what we
would do in order to do that as we'd
write it down so at the time Reid was a
guy who thought in PowerPoint he does
outlines right so PowerPoint is good for
him and so he said let's have an off
side we're going to talk about values
and I said let's not we've got a
business to figure out and it's usually
just an esoteric waste of time you know
and Ron said integrity and they carved
it in marble and they didn't mean it so
I don't want to do that like tell me
what to put on a t-shirt we'll buy some
t-shirts I don't care and I said but you
know what I will do I will write down
behaviors let's write down like if we
say integrity we need to say this is
what it looks like this is what you act
like when you have integrity and this is
what it looks like when you don't and if
you don't you don't work here anymore
it's gonna be that straightforward so we
did that and if you those of you have
ever seen the Netflix culture deck
that's the first part of it we rewrote
that section seven times because we
would what we do is we'd get back with
all the leaders of our team and we'd say
okay let's go through this name a person
that's doing this name a person that's
doing this name and if we couldn't we
would say is that a value that really
matters is that a behavior that we care
is that are we true to okay that's
chapter one okay but so then we wrote
high performance so the Netflix culture
deck took ten years to write because it
took ten years to figure it out so
another day we're driving to reading a
car pulled a lot he says I met this
woman last night who created this really
cool company they put PowerPoint decks
on the Internet I said that is such a
great idea I wonder what people are
gonna put out there and he said oh I put
the deck up it was an internal
onboarding document we didn't write that
to be a viral treatise on how to run
your company we wrote it so that when
you joined Netflix we could say oh by
the way we should tell you how it works
around here and I freaked out okay so
anybody seen the Netflix culture deck
that power
presentation it's ugly as sin I said oh
god read it's the graphics
I mean arrows and the yin and yang you
know when people kind of loved it
because it was so dorky he said you
never told me it was dork him like yeah
I didn't want to hurt your feelings and
and then I said you're gonna scare all
our candidates because in the culture
deck it says adequate performance gets a
generous severance package and he said
only the lines we don't want

Patty McCord, former chief talent officer, Netflix | Code Conference 2018
it's great to be last because you get to
kind of put together all the themes that
we've heard
and what I want to focus on is kind of
more personal to you and to your
companies I want to talk about you know
we heard a lot of people talking about
we have to create work in a way that's
for the 21st century and not the 20th
century and what I do now I've been gone
from Netflix for about six years and so
since I've been working with like little
bitty startups and really big
corporations it's so weird I find so
many things we do at work to be like
straight out of the 60s
it's just crazy stuff so in general I
want you to think about and I'll wrap on
this again at the end there's a whole
bunch of stuff that we do because we've
always done it and we have this weird
management language around it like we
say one of my biggest rants is the
annual performance review which i think
is utter waste of time but you know why
we do it because everybody else does it
and then when everybody else does it we
call it best practices like measured by
whoo right so what I do in my life now
is I go around talking to people about
questioning the things that we do about
how we manage people that whether or not
they are actually functional anymore I
mean basically functional not only could
we do it better but are there a lot of
things that we could throw away so what
I thought I would do today I took my
assignment very seriously and I want to
teach you a lesson I'm not a Harvard
professor so I won't be calling on you
unless you want to be and was that cool
or what
right so my lessons a little bit
different I want to give you a lesson in
building a great company and I ask
you're a student I want you to think
about this as how you're going to think
about your career forever and here's the
fundamental basics of what underlies my
theory first of all unless you're a
student raise your hand if you're in the
same company that you joined when you
graduated from college
okay - I've done groups of 5,000 people
and it's
- so the idea of retention and that
you're going to join a firm and it's
going to take care of you and your
career for the rest of your life is over
and if you're running a company or
you're running a team I want you to
think about about ways that we can
create organizations that are really
effective real time and my biggest
message to you and one of the secrets to
our success at Netflix was that we
always focused on the company that we
wanted to be not the company that we are
so for those of you that heard Greg
Peters this morning that was exactly how
we transition from one business to
another business to another business
because we had enormous clarity about
what the new business looked like so
here's my teaching for you it's an
exercise and you can all do it in six
months and I choose six months as a time
frame because it's kind of polar like if
I go to a little startup I'm like so
when do you want this to happen they're
like someday and then when I go to a big
corporation it's like it's part of our
five-year plan neither one of them are
very good answers and so it's hard one
of the things we don't do particularly
well as you put time wrappers on things
so I think a really good time wrapper is
six months I think we can predict six
months out pretty well right in six
months if your team was amazing your
company your team amazing and I don't
mean like smidge better and I don't mean
doing more I mean like everyone around
you is like holy these guys are
amazing they pulled it off what will be
occurring then that's not occurring now
okay
and give me all your numerals you've got
them all those metrics it's more revenue
it's better retention it's newer
customers it's accelerating the
technology you all have numbers right
especially as tech people we just love
our numerals so that's okay give me all
your números put him in the little pile
here and then make a movie of it and
you're walking around and this team is
amazing I mean oh my god it's incredible
what's happening what do you see are
there more meetings are there less
meetings are people like getting in
conference rooms and having knock-down
drag-out fights on behalf of the
customer and doing the right thing or
somebody saying god that sounds like a
stupid idea coming out of marketing I
better go find out what they're doing
what's occurring then that's not
occurring now okay and when I talk to
CEOs I see the little you know I almost
see people close their eyes and they can
see their amazing company and then you
say well in order for those things to
occur what would people need to know how
to do so if you're in a start-up or
you're in a young company that's going
to be successful and you can hold it in
your hand your issues are often around
scaling we talked about this a lot of
people talked about this over the
conference they're either about scalar
complexity and here's a deal with scale
I think that humans can imagine 10x some
people may be 50 but man it's hard to
imagine a hundred unless you've seen 50
and so that's the part of your
organization where sometimes it's time
when you scale to bring in people that
have seen stuff that you haven't seen
before remember the key to the scaling
question is time so with anybody with
Greg Peters and you guys are here this
morning but do you guys okay
so one of the things they talked about
was cloud technology
I remember at Netflix when so here's a
good Netflix story we've grown 30%
quarter-over-quarter three quarters in a
row pretty impressive right so we come
to our executive team meeting and Reed
Hastings wants to do what Reed Hastings
like to do is disaster planning like
what if it what if it didn't what if it
all went to hell a morrow so we decided
at that time just for support we would
do like what if it kept going what if we
kept growing 30% quarter-over-quarter
three quarters in a row so we go our CFO
goes to the white board he does top-line
revenue and he's doing that happy dance
that CFO's do like money that's Barry
McCarthy who's CFO a Spotify now right
so he likes those he likes when those
numbers look like that so he's doing the
happy dance Ted sir and as head of
content looks at the numbers and at the
time we would wisp Elysees some day will
be as big as HBO some day and Ted's look
at the numbers he's like you guys
that's next year like that's the that's
that's a possibility so then we're all
stunned right because really that was
like in our lifetime right oh my god and
our then head of product said by the way
that's a third of the US Internet
bandwidth and we thought you know how do
you even think about those things in
those days so we kept under the
conversation I sit down with Neil and I
said does anybody know how to do that he
said I didn't know I'm like do we know
how to do that it's like absolutely not
right so we start brainstorming like
who's moving who's moving big chunks of
data is it is it eBay is it Amazon's at
Google I mean who knows about video who
knows about this this is a big big
problem and we also realize it's got to
be in the cloud right it has to happen
in the cloud because we're running
dvd-by-mail out of a data center so we
go to our data center guys and we say
hey guys here's a problem and they say
like all good engineers no worries
go exec something we got this we'll
build the cloud and I looked at those
guys and I thought you know if anybody
on God's earth could build us a cloud
its you but not nine months right so
when we had that conversation with those
folks they were like what do you mean
you know I've been here seven years I've
built this amazing data center what am I
not going to be part of that
and the answer was maybe not right maybe
not so if you took look at realistically
where you're going to go sometimes when
you get to issues of scale or complexity
you have to work backwards and say how
do I make sure that I put together the
right team of people who can do that
because then and only then you look at
the skills and experience of the people
that you have on the team and the reason
why I want to teach you this methodology
is not just that it allows you to assess
the skills and experiences that you have
on your team this methodology can do a
lot of things for you number one you
have now got clarity about the vision
for your team you can articulate it you
can tell the people that are currently
working here what's going to happen in
the next six months to a year timeframe
how cool is that huh you're setting the
context for what you're actually going
to do in a time frame with numerals with
articulation with an idea about what
you're going to need to be good at then
you can follow up with every member of
the team and decide whether or not
they're the right people to do it going
forward right so here's the scary thing
I tell HR people I say you know how you
end you know how you hire somebody to do
something and then they do it and then
it's done then we all worry about what's
next sometimes what's next is something
next somewhere else my fundamental thing
at Netflix that changed my life was I
decided I wanted to create a great
company to be from so I want you to sit
with that for a second if that's your
job if you run a company or you run an
organization if you spent every single
day saying I'm going to create a team of
people that does such amazing work that
having that on their resume means
something you're going to think about
things a lot differently okay so the
other thing about when you back up in
this methodology so now I've said now
I'm able to have a conversation with
everybody on my team and say gee I don't
know let's think about what your role is
going to be on this team six months
especially if we're going to change ears
and you know those honest conversations
you can have them you can have them you
got six months
to have the conversation because you've
already talked about it and people
understand the context of what you're
trying to do that's thing what think too
is now you know who'd hire
right now you're hiring for the deltas
and the deltas that you're hiring for
are people who are going to help you
solve that problem six months out and
when you look for people to solve a
problem then you you'll take anybody who
can help you do it because here's how it
typically works in a company you write a
requisition to hire someone new okay I
know how this works I I was a recruiter
what are requisitions what do they
describe the person that left that you
didn't want to leave the fantasy person
that doesn't exist whatever it takes to
get it approved and then ask for - am i
right
and then you say when I hire that person
who do I want to hire someone articulate
smart best on their feet good decision
maker someone just like me
maybe maybe ten years ago because I
don't really want to be threatened by
then-current me right which is how we
end up hiring like hires like hires like
hires like cars like so if you start
with the problem and you work your way
back to who could do it you might hire
somebody differently then you might hire
before you might even hire a woman you
might even hire a woman or a man that's
sitting in front of you so the first
place we all look those of us who manage
other people is we and this is you guys
who've done this you know what I'm
talking about it's like oh we got
this terrible problem yeah we got to get
on this we got to put together a team
who should run the team
what about right so you want to make
sure that whoever that name is you've
got five of them so you need to
constantly be working on who are those
people that can lead the
seems to solve the problems that are in
front of you and then you might take
somebody inside of your company and you
might go dude we got this problem you're
actually not qualified but you've solved
a lot of problems here you understand
the company you understand the time
frame you have a track record of
delivering things we're gonna give you a
chance we're gonna take a chance are you
willing right so then I can say to you
this might not work out and the right
thing for the company is to have the
right person in the job and it might not
be you but if you're willing to take the
risk I'm willing to take the risk and
that kind of honesty gives us both a
better chance instead of six months
later you're going well why'd you give
me the job if you didn't think I could
do it right
management people get cynical when we
lie to them I worked with geeks my whole
life right
I love conferences like this it's like
I'm with my people
engineers software engineers here's how
they're wired most of you know this but
I'll put it in the plain English the
world is good or bad it's right or wrong
it's black or white it's zero or one
anything in between is there's
there's no such thing as nuance in the
engineer brain right so we can tell the
engineer brain an absolute fact can you
we're gonna give it a try maybe you can
do it maybe you can't do it and so when
we constantly do this we're able to
build teams that create the
organizations of the future not being
able to only do what we want to do with
the teams that we already have and it
doesn't mean that I don't like lifelong
learning I do
lifelong learning might be being in a
number of firms all through your career
it doesn't mean that I don't think
developing people isn't a good thing to
do I do I think it's a wonderful thing
to do I think you need to be very
realistic about timeframes so when
somebody says to you early in their
career I'm in finance and I'd like to be
a CFO it's really important that you let
them know it's not Thursday okay
that there's a there's a progression of
how those progressions go if you're
early in your career for my students in
the room remember what I said so when
you go interview for a job what what do
you want to find out what's the problem
we're trying to solve that's the only
thing you need to find out in an
interview what's the problem the teams
trying to solve and what would be your
role in helping to solve it and then you
want to look at solving those problems
for the rest of your life so I have an
algorithm for success this is I say the
word algorithm because it makes me sound
smart it's what you love to do that
you're extraordinarily good at doing
something we need someone to be great at
and so when somebody on your team is
cranky it could be because they finished
building that amazing thing and now
you'd like them to maintain it and then
I made Tanner's they're builders and
they don't want to do it anymore but
they still have a job and that's what
you want them to do so you made them do
it and so they'll stay but they'll be
cranky or when you find yourself coming
to work and you say if only they realize
that I'm a writer they just don't care
about this amazing skill I have they
might not care okay so both those sides
of the equation are how you think about
how you pass through your career for the
rest of your life right and the other
dimension that's really interesting that
I think speaks highly to like the me2
movement that we've talked about today
is you're it's not just your
demographics I mean like I hate the word
millennial like you're a millennial I
was a millennial
it's called being in your 20s what do
you want everything when do you want it
now right and then things change right
my son's 30 I tease him I'm like
somebody a third lineal docked to call
you a new name now but as things change
as your life changes then you have
different trade-offs so remember all the
dimensions you have you have where the
person's at in their career what the
timeframe is for them to acquire the
skills they need to do the great job
how it is that you're a calm
accommodating the space that they have
in their life right so those early stage
startups the reason why they tend to be
populated by young people who work all
the time is that young people can work
all the time
right I had this I had this reporter
call me it wasn't Cara who said her
theory was all of the great candidates
all of the great talent in the world is
flocking to the coast to live in the
cities because San Francisco in New York
or the coolest places to live and all
the big tech companies it's over Silicon
Valley is over because the whole world
is going to these two urban areas right
so that all reporters have a parenthesis
your premise and I said wow that's
that's kind of interesting you know have
you ever been the Facebook campus have
you been to the Facebook campus that is
a direct replica of Mission Street in
San Francisco oh yeah that's cool like
why do you think they're not in Mission
Street in San Francisco because they're
not cool I'm like no they don't fit like
10,000 people and there's 10,000 people
on Mission Street in San Francisco and
oh by the way the reason why they're in
Mountain View is because they can have
that giant campus and the reason why
they could have a lot of people in that
giant campuses a lot of people are gonna
want to have children and families and
they're gonna be on a different campus
right then the urban life isn't for
everybody right and the other thing is
they're going to be able to attract and
retain and develop people who want to
solve bigger and better problems so you
want to think about the size and the
scope of the problems that you're trying
to solve and who has the experience and
the desire to help you solve those
problems and once you have that
articulation then you can build the team
of tomorrow not just riff off the team
that you have today and the other thing
you can do for me is when you build that
team of tomorrow in order to make them
unbelievably successful remember how
we've set the map now this is what we
need to do this is how we need to do it
this is what our time frame is for doing
it then what I want you to do in order
to make
successful is just get out of the way
get out of the way if you're doing stuff
that seems to be wasting it stop wasting
your time and wasting their time and
slowing you down then consider rather
than reinventing it to just stop doing
it and see whether or not it matters
right I'll leave you with feedback
because I did say the part about how I
hate the annual performance review and I
do thinks stupid but I think feedback is
really important and so I want you to
think about when feedback is effective
and the one that we mow most people
think that feedback means constructive
criticism means telling somebody
something that they don't like but being
nice about it which if you're an
engineer this does not flow right
doesn't make any sense it is an effect
it's a feedback mechanism that we must
always use I usually translate it into
guilt-tripping it's what you do with
your kids or your pets right that bad
thing you did don't do that bad thing
again and then the next time you do that
bad thing cuz you will you'll feel bad
and eventually you'll stop doing but I
mean it's really slow so consider this
kind of feedback that was amazing right
there right then do that again and
you'll do that five times this afternoon
so remember that feedback in the moment
is really really important
feedback in the moment means you can say
hey man that conversation we just had
was kind of weird and you're
mansplaining again so stop doing that
and you can stop doing that
right instead of reporting it to HR that
there's a pattern of harassment right so
the more we can get in people's faces
talking to each other about what we need
to do be successful what the reality of
our work is what the time frame of what
we need to get done and how we serve the
customer each and every day then I think
we're going to be able to build there's
amazing companies for the 21st century
thank you

Building a magnetic culture: Patty McCord
hello everyone welcome back to Franklin
cubbies on leadership series my name is
Scott Miller and I serve as your weekly
host and interviewer could not be more
anticipating today's guest we have one
of the most practical opinionated
outspoken and seasons talent experts
joining us Patti McCord the former chief
talent officer of Netflix and the author
of the best-selling book powerful
building a culture of freedom and
responsibility
Patti McCord welcome to Franklin cubbies
on leadership thanks hey delighted to
have you thank you for taking time out
of the surf calling in today from Santa
Cruz California say hi to our dear
friend Guy Kawasaki by the way I'm
guessing you're not out surfing today or
do you plan to be the same for me
especially with all the shark attacks
coming hot in the US right we don't want
to lose the dog to the shark or you
patty thanks for joining us today I am
I'm very excited about our conversation
because you and I are like sort of
separated at Birth from different
mothers because I think you are a
tent-like it is wise but very
sophisticated talent leader that's you
know you've had a couple of thousand
reps right in lots of hours lots of
years decades in the trenches you came
up through a couple different companies
kind of finished your corporate career
Netflix you're now an in-demand author
speaker or writer counselor coach to
other executives I'm very excited to get
into the conversation around your book
powerful which is sold just shy of a
hundred thousand copies and a year and a
half which is incredible and talk about
all the lessons you've learned around
building a high-performance culture
where you provide employees freedom to
bring their best selves to work first I
want to take a moment and have you talk
a bit about your journey your
partnership with Reid the CEO and
founder of Netflix kind of how you came
to be part of that organization kind of
what you're doing now and then we'll die
into the book and your thoughts around
building a high-performance culture okay
I got into tech as a recruiter and I
think that deeply colored my thinking
over time because when you start as a
recruiter you're kind of a matchmaker
and what you want to do is you want to
keep deep into what problems somebody's
trying to solve what kind of team
they're gonna build and finding the
right person to do it and then to be a
great recruiter and I was a great
recruiter you have to really understand
what makes people different people tick
and I particularly got into recruiting
engineers very logical very
straightforward people which matched
really well with my personality because
they're kind of no BS kind of folks so
that's how I got started and I and I
worked in a couple of tech companies I
worked at Sun Microsystems when Sun was
the big company in the Silicon Valley I
worked at a couple companies here in
Santa Cruz and the true story is one of
the VP's of the company I worked with
had left to join startup and I had sort
of coached him through making that
decision and I called him at his company
which is a company named pure software
and said hey you know you should hire me
I'm kind of bored here how's your HR
person doing you should do a
recommendation for me and he said no you
told me if I took anybody from this
company Portland you would break both my
legs and I said oh I do need me so he
said I'm not gonna do it press star six
nine and it would redial and so I did
that and Reed Hastings sister who was
the receptionist at the time answered
the phone and I said hello I'd like to
speak with mr. Hastings and she put me
through
that's how I met Reed so I was somebody
called pure software and he asked me
what my HR philosophy was and I started
speaking fluent HR speak you know really
that I believe it's about integrating
the mission and vision into my
individual goals and incentives and
providing calm
hence of policies and procedures so that
people can achieve their best self and
he looked at me he said did you say
anything in that sentence like don't you
people even use words like that me so
we've gotten an argument and I came home
and it's been said how'd it go and I
said well I got in a fight with the CEO
and he said you know you have to grow up
you're the breadwinner of this family
you're gonna have to be a real HR person
someday you're gonna be sorry that you
keep doing this and Reid hired me so
that company we grew through acquisition
we acquired four other companies before
we were acquired by our largest
competitor and we did everything by the
book literally I would take their
employee handbook and iron and play
handbook and smashing together and that
would be the new policy met on the new
employee I didn't think at all about
what the policies were I just added more
every time we got bigger because I
figured that's what companies do right
and our largest competitor eventually
bought us and did what we did whenever
we bought a company got rid of all the
executives so remember our jobs and I
started consulting again and breed and a
guy named Mark Randolph co-founded
Netflix so the Netflix story is where
you called me up in the middle of the
night I and I mean literally like 3:00
in the morning
I said he says are you sleeping and I'm
like of course I'm sleeping it's 3
o'clock in the morning what do you want
and he said I'm gonna go run Netflix
with Mark and I said okay what is this a
career a career advice call like sounds
like a great idea Reid you go do that
and he said no i'm calling because i
want you to come too and I said
seriously
go back to sleep there's no way you know
I'm riding my bike every day my kids
know my name I've got tons of free time
call something that hasn't done it
started with you because I don't want to
do that again says that's thing one
thing too is that put DVDs in the mail
it's just a dumbest idea ever you know
you and the three other people that have
and I said give me one good reason why I
would do that I'd give up the life I had
to do that with you and he said let's
make it the company we always dreamed up
okay so now I'm awake right and I said
well if we did that how would you know
and he said I'd walk in the door every
day and I'd want to solve these problems
with these people
I thought you know that's pretty
compelling I said what about you you
know what would it be like for you and I
said I'm gonna be cool if we were a
great company to be from and I kind of
said it facetiously thinking you know
maybe someday we'd be like Apple or
Google or big guy Google probably hadn't
was barely started back then they you
know a company where being at Netflix
net you were a tackle and now I look
back on that night and I think wow it's
kind of become my life's work to talk to
people about creating companies at a
great place Patti it's a great journey
talk about the inflection point that you
wrote about in your book about when
Netflix kind of became relevant talk
about the transition and what happened
at Christmas and DVD players in the year
2000 because everybody else was and we
had gone and pitched our IPO on Sand
Hill Road we were drinking champagne
eating caviar talking about a hundred
dollar stock in our private jets and
that was the year the first dot-com
bubble burst and the economy in the bay
area I just went to hell and companies
were just going down left and right you
know pets.com was going you know the big
companies were all going and our bankers
pulled our IPO and it was a very
capital-intensive business at the time
because we had to buy DVDs and stamps
and envelopes so the most of our
employees were people that put DVDs into
envelopes to mail them right so every
literally every cent of profit which we
had none of every cent we got up we
spent DVDs class 20 bucks apiece
neighborhoods very expensive so around
so they pull the IPO we didn't have very
much money in the bank September 11th
happened and threats happened reporter
there's powder in the mail right so of
course the San Jose Police Department's
down at our warehouse off something has
come through the mail right so in
October of 2001 I laid off a third of
the company we weren't very big but it
was a third and I laid myself off
because I figured and Reid talked me
into he's like don't go yet
if we can't make payroll buy genuine
very you know then you can leave so what
happened that Christmas was DVD players
drop 299 dollars a piece and every one
of us bought one and the only marketing
that we could afford to do is put a
cardboard red ticket inside HDE player
box that said trying Netflix for free
and I'm a businessman it was we were
doing and we couldn't afford to hire
anybody right because remember every
time I get a new customer I gotta buy
three DVDs they have some table some
people to put him in so we were doing
twice as much work with the third oh so
many people and it was more fun and
that's that's when we said let's try and
keep this feeling and and it's when I
looked around and I realized you know I
had said goodbye to anybody who wasn't
technically capable and working on that
making just the dvd-by-mail service
better I said goodbye to almost all of
middle management because I couldn't
have anybody around whose job it was to
tell somebody else what to do right just
had to do it and I say goodbye to
honestly all the babies and whiners and
complainers because it had to be people
that really wanted to work hard and make
it happen and in the end we got more
done and we got more done with less
rules and what we did instead of
creating processes and guidelines
and rules as we got bigger was we just
said let us look we had a meeting every
Friday and more every Friday in the
parking lot we called it the metrics
meet and we literally passed out pieces
of paper that were the executive
dashboard and everything right this is
how much money is coming in here it's
how much we're spending there's how many
customers we have here's what our
problems are usually issues are I mean
we had basically an executive session
with every employee in the company every
Friday so looking back on it now I
realize we taught people how to reason
Rheda P&L and we assumed that they could
get it right we assumed that we had
smart people and they would ask and the
honest truth was it was a really
fabulous great meeting and you know it
was also the meeting we had that before
the layoff to where people said you know
things are looking pretty tough it seems
like the only thing we have left to cut
as salaries are you guys thinking of
laying people off and we said yeah it's
on the table everything's on the table
so that kind of transparency was
something we did from the very beginning
and we just built on it because it
worked so well patty is such an
inspiring but sobering story you were at
Netflix for a 14 years chief talent
officer left you know a little over a
half decade ago from you know buying
DVDs with every dollar you had - now do
you know what the revenue of Netflix is
about gross revenue I you know when I
left Netflix I said to read so what's
next world world domination and I had
dinner with him a couple of weeks ago
I'm like where is it Mars next I mean
you going with Ilan conquered the world
so what do you know clearly revenue is
in the multiple billions so it's just
really fat that's fascinating but it's
it's so inspiring to hear you because
you're an entrepreneur maybe you don't
call yourself that but you clearly are a
scrappy roll up your sleeves and get it
done entrepreneur and look what's
happened in less than 20 years
patty I want to get into your point of
view your experience your opinions on
the role that HR plays in organizations
first I want to talk about this concept
at Netflix of hiring fully formed adults
as you call it and the role that that
plays in the decision-making around
recruitment and retention talk a bit
about this concept of fully formed
adults read says I'm not supposed to say
fully formed because none of us are ever
fully formed we keep informing all the
time so I'll put that caveat in there
I just mean mature I mean people who and
and when I say fully formed adults where
I talk about it those I'm not talking
about age because I've seen really
mature 20 year olds that are really
capable of doing really important work
that matters and I seem really immature
for Michael's right so I mean people who
are you know grownups they're
responsible they have and and and maybe
I also mean in every job I mean people
have mortgages and they have cars and
they have families and they have you
know responsibilities outside of work so
I think it's really foolish to think
that when somebody walks in the door
that they suddenly lose all that
responsibility right and so I think that
you can tell in an interview whether or
not somebody's gonna feel responsible
for the work that they do and make sure
that you only hire those people that do
and the other thing is to make sure that
you hire people who appreciate teamwork
and want to be part of a team I found in
the Silicon Valley particularly there's
this sort of the myth of the superstar
right the individual contributor that
can do unbelievably amazing work and
they don't have to be very you know have
to get along with other people to do it
and I find those in place just to be
just a rat hole my theory is a third of
the people love the company you know are
smart people who love the company and
they're gonna be pretty positive about
what you're trying to do and
is up to 1/3 of the people that are kind
of suspicious of management and it may
be from their upbringing or people of
places they've worked before where they
think well you know the leadership just
going to scream if you don't watch out
those people have to go because the
people in the middle pay attention to
whoever gets the most education so you
know you always you really love the
problems that you have to solve and and
it's not just the product right it's not
just a company or the reputation of the
company you want people this is from my
recruiting background you want adults
who say yeah this sounds like something
I could get up in the morning and get
excited about salt and that's how you
get all those right matches that's how
you put the right teams together
Patti from reading the book from reading
your HBR article which was exceptional I
highly recommend people go in Google
Patty's article and Harvard Business
Review and watching their talks you seem
like a brutal pragmatist like a positive
pragmatist which I really kind of cleave
to you remind me a lot of Kim Scott from
radical candor in terms of your
philosophy and we had a gas header as
our guest also I especially liked the
chapter of the section around your
opinion on performance improvement plans
call pips you don't you don't cloud your
opinion on them talk a bit about why you
think they're sort of bit fraudulent you
share a great story about talking with
the manager and kind of calling him or
her out on what's the purpose don't we
know where this is going let's just be
humane and talk straight when you kind
of walk us through your philosophy and
share that story sure one of the first
and I noticed that everybody in the
audience was on their phone and this is
before I realized that everybody in the
audience was tweeting but one of my
favorite tweets out of that talk was
patting accord says our IP the IP you
know sometimes we hire people to build
something or to do something and over
time they finish it right you hire
somebody to build something a couple
years later it's built and then you say
oh well I'd like you to maintain that
and the person can do that they're just
not going to be very good at it or very
excited about it and then we're mad
because they're not doing a great job
and they're and they're kind of not
acting excited about working at the
company anymore and they're mad because
we've asked them to do something that
they don't really want to do which isn't
what got them there and isn't what got
them the recognition they got before and
pretty soon the relationships ours and
then we're going to do this performance
improvement plan process which is a
complete joke because we know that this
person we're talking about is not not
performing they're not performing
because they're not doing the work that
they love to do I have what I call an
algorithm for success so some of my
radical candor comes from years and
years of working with engineers and so
for those of you out there who work with
engineers particularly software
engineers they see the world in a very
particular way it's good or bad it's
right or wrong it's black or white it's
zero or one right and so with very
logical people the thing that makes the
performance improvement plan so
ridiculous to them is that they know
it's a lie
right they know they know that it's a
game to get rid of them and and it's
completely heartless and cruel and so
the story I think you're referring to in
my book is of a manager who had a woman
on the team who was someone who was
doing at the time we did we did manual
quality assurance right we did manual
testing a lot of the products when we
first started streaming and eventually
we wanted to automate all that stuff so
that we didn't have to test every single
device and so the manager came in and
said you know it's it's time for us to
say goodbye should we put on a
performance improvement plan and things
like she's the last person doing this in
the company which means she's the best
right we're not choosing a performance
isn't me
improving we just don't need her to do
this anymore right
and imagine if you did that I just think
pips are the cruelest thing that we do
right so every Wednesday morning a
manager is going to sit down with
somebody and they're gonna prove in
writing that this person isn't comment
which means every Tuesday night the
managers going to go to bed with an
upset stomach and probably drink too
much and so will they avoid and then by
the third Wednesday morning that
person's going to end up crying and oh
by the way we completely forget the
entire audience for the performance
improvement lab is everybody's teaming
right everybody knows what happens every
Wednesday morning and it sometimes is
even the same people that came to the
manager said you know she's really not
into it anymore and she's not doing a
very good job that she should probably
go are the same people who are now
coming and going why do you make her cry
every Wednesday then this is so cool
this is so heartless and so you know I
just think the act itself is really mean
I think can't think of anything else
that we do that's ruler and I think that
most people can hear the truth I think
and in this particular case we sat down
with this person said we love you to
bits we just don't believe you anymore
and you know and I spend a bunch of time
going where can you go where you're
gonna be the next best QA person and
there's plenty of opportunities for
somebody as talented as that and so I
just you know I do a talk right now
where I talk about how I get to be on
stage with professional coaches now and
I talk about being on stage with the
winningest coach in the National Hockey
League guy named Scott Bowman and Scott
Bowman's secret to success is he sits
down with each of his players
individually every 10 games up there 80
games season and he puts together a plan
for them you know what girls they want
to do what the practice they want to do
with their teammates know their
competition is what their strategy for
winning is what you know and and
somebody said to me the
he does this and the moderator on stage
says that sounds like a great plan mr.
Boehm Patty McCord they say you picked a
performance improvement plan what would
you recommend we do instead and I said
but he said you know performance
improvement is something that you do all
the time I don't have any problems with
improving performance I don't even have
a problem with the plan to do it I have
a problem with the farce would you
please come and fire me me not today
radio producer and he said do you know
the truth is we're going to go we don't
need to broadcast radio anymore and each
anymore and you should probably find
something else it's so big laughs it was
later he sent me an email instead I
couldn't stop thinking wow I really I
want you to be the person who fires me
maybe tonight maybe next year but I feel
like it might be the best day of my life
plus you have a legacy of paying big
severance is so I'm probably up for
right I mean it's just there's just the
whole thing is terrible
right our careers our journeys for not
the same place forever I just did talk
with 1,000 CEOs 1000 of them and I said
raise your hand if you're in the job
that you had when you graduated from the
University
No all right no one raised their hand I
say raise your hand if you measure
retention in your company
yet that phrase got someone elected
president right so there must be
something around that yeah we won't go
there okay so let's talk about let's
talk Patti before we go to the culture
deck which of course you've achieved
some accidental but you know well-earned
fame around your role and then Alf
infamous famous ubiquitous 10 million
downloaded versions of the Netflix
culture deck let's go there in just a
second I have it in my hand here first I
want you to talk straight and give some
advice to the millions of people
listening today that happened to be in a
human performance human resource talent
development organizational development
coaching capacity in their company in
that kind of broad HR suite give them
some tough love on how to become Buber
relevant in their organization or make
sure that they're adding enormous value
so the Reed Hastings and the patty
maclaurins of the world find them kind
of quote in their boat rowing with them
first stop speaking
HR speak just just stop stop stop with
the words in the language that nobody
understands except other HR people I'm
not kidding and start speaking the
language of the business you're in and
if you don't know how to read your P&L
and you don't know what the most
important goals are and you don't know
what all the say of those targets are
what makes a customer extraordinarily
happy you you know I used to tell my HR
team yes we are a service organization
it is not spelled STR V a and TS
and the people we serve don't work here
the people we serve are the people that
use our service that use Netflix your
neighbors your kids teacher the guy at
the grocery store the guy that's working
in your cart that's who we serve and we
serve them by making sure that we have
incredible effective teams in our
organization that make great products
for them so the most important thing you
can do is get out of your HR role and
get into your business role what is it
that's going to take to make the
business successful so that's number one
number two stop spinning thr ski and the
third most important advice I could give
people that they almost rarely pay is
throw something away so I've been
surrounded by innovators my whole life
and when I was at Netflix and we were
inventing the streaming service we
didn't say you know let's make broadcast
TV just a snitch better right I'm sure
somebody can do better than the cable
you know grid we said let's make this an
amazing compelling experience for people
to hear stories from all over the world
the stories that they're gonna love to
hear stories that are gonna really move
them right and so when your goal is that
then you have to stop doing things that
don't matter anymore and I find in most
companies most HR policies and
procedures and when I when I pin down
the HR person say tell me what the
purpose of the annual performance
bonuses right but that's here's a great
example right we do an annual
performance buzz I was just coaching a
company here in San Francisco and I was
and I'm talking to the CFO and the head
of HR and they've spent the entire month
of December rolling up everybody's goals
and okay ours and all the business
objectives doing the calculations to
department by department team by team
individual by individual to pay the
year-end performance bonus that they
always pay
and have always paid right and I said so
if I look at this objectively this
really isn't an award for performance is
it its deferred compensation because you
always get it right and I said then
let's take a look at your employee
population here in San Francisco the
most expensive city to live in the
nation probably at this point and so
what are they gonna do go to their
landlord and say oh yes I can pay you
that extra $1,000 a month in rent can I
give it to you in January because I
always get a $12,000 bonus in January
right so I mean it's an example of like
I'm not saying that bonuses might not be
a good thing in the organization but how
do you know that work right we don't
ever say well without them or why not
just say you know this is what I did
it's I said tell you what we don't do
performance bonuses we just expect a lot
from you
we're just gonna we're just gonna roll
that in and pay you more but we're gonna
expect more we're gonna expect you to be
a high performer all the time that's how
that works
and you know what works out just fine so
the so the bias is to really spend some
time every day once a week looking
around you and saying why is it we do
that
is it still relevant and if we started
from scratch would we do it that way
right we're managing people like we did
in the nineteen sixty-five you know the
idea that it's our job in HR to protect
us even we're kind of getting
schizophrenic here don't you think like
on the one hand you got to protect the
company from those evil employees that
might sue you and on the other hand
that's your job is to make them
deliriously happy all I mean you know no
wonder people are confused as to why
we're there
patty you and others at Netflix really
kind of flipped the script on a lot of
the culture policies you know the human
resource policies on vacation pay and
travel employee reimbursement I love the
phrase I think is there a five word
phrase that defines the travel policy
and Netflix talked about that so when we
get to talking about the culture deck
I'll tell you that I was I think of
myself as the CEO of the culture the
chief operating officers like how do you
actually make this stuff work right so
here's the story of actor the company's
best interest we had gone public the
auditors were all over us the Sox guys
were all over us it was time for the
grown-up policies and procedures and at
the time you know we had been operating
pretty much within budgets because we
talked about money all the time with
everyone right and we didn't give people
a lot of parameters we just said you
know do what you need to do so now the
sudden it was time for a travel policy
that had to be approved by Finance and
as an expense policy that had to be
approved by finance and so that one of
the stories I tell is I we've moved
offices in LA and I went down and I said
the receptionist to facilitate the move
and I said oh we're in took place I got
my new to cook down and she said oh you
should stay at the place I'm staying
around the corner
it's called ladder and Taj and I said
you see
there and she said yeah I got a
corporate rate it was only $800 and I as
she said room service is amazing and I'm
gonna at lunch to get a hot stone
massage right so I come back and I said
tell the story the CFO and he's just see
see what I mean see if we had a travel
policy she wouldn't be making mistakes
like that Patty and I pulled out a copy
of her her travel you know her expense
bill and a copy of the mover bill like
the movers had pizza for lunch right and
they were the same and I'm like her
issue is not that she can't read a
policy her issue is that it's the
company's money when she's paying the
movers and it's not the cut and it's not
her money when she's paying the hotel
right and we should be thinking about it
in the same way and so why should
somebody with the PhD in math go ask
somebody in finance for approval of an
expenditure over $10,000 they know what
greater than 10,000 is right instead and
this took years right these are like
when you decide to do things differently
that doesn't happen overnight
instead what we did over the years was
take all of those people in finance
whose job it is to approve stuff and
replace them with people who can sit on
the team with the teams at their team
meetings and say to them hey by the way
you know we've budgeted $10,000 per
employee for equipment the expenses and
our run rates twelve of what do we want
to do that right and I think it's
because we're purchasing these sorts of
things that we hadn't anticipated when
we when we did the first draft of the
budget last year right and so those are
meaningful conversations about how the
business works and how you spend money
and how you do things that are the ones
that actually get work done rather than
having somebody go ask permission from
somebody else and it's also been my
experience that if it's your job to give
somebody permission to do something you
get your power from saying no
patty let's use the remaining part of
our time to talk about the now-famous
Netflix culture deck instead of asking
you questions I just like to turn it
over to you and have you kind of tell us
the truth
behind how this was developed how its
transitioned what confusion it may have
caused out in the industry and and why
you created a reference deck just kind
of um take maybe five or seven minutes
and just kind of walk us through its
truth okay well like I told you in the
early story of how I came to Netflix
what and and how read and I wanted to
create a company that we both wanted to
work for what we decided to do
differently was write it down and at the
time read was the kind of guy who thinks
in PowerPoint right he likes making
lists he likes he likes the outline
format and so he and I on our run on
lines would say so the first chapter if
you go back and read the Netflix culture
deck what you have in front of you the
first chapter is a chapter on behaviors
we value he says let's go outside and do
a values exercise and I said let's not
you know we've got a lot of what to do
and I think this is sort of esoteric and
I'm not sure any of the values exercises
we ever did in our last company ended up
to mean anything and I said but I will
help write down the kind of behaviors
that we expect let's write down instead
of values let's write down what you're
gonna do
rewarded for and what you're gonna get
punished for not doing right let's write
down we really want smart people that's
right tell me when adults let's write
down that we want people who are going
to be responsible let's write down those
behaviors and so that part of the
culture day so what would happen
literally this is the truth maybe I
would go through a couple of graphs at a
one-on-one he would usually do most of
the writing of it we'd bring it back and
we would take it to our executive staff
and to say hey we're thinking about
publishing this to the rest of the
company and using it as an onboarding
document so that people can know what
they're getting into when they join
Netflix and you know when we started
doing some of the controversial
getting rid of time off you know the
headon great debates we would have the
executive team were so healthy you know
we started talking about high
performance and only having people that
were into it and doing great job and
only high performing people but we had a
couple of people on our executive team
who are like I know who would want to
work in a place like this right what
about loyalty what about what about
feeling like a family you guys are
Stewart's illicitly saying we're not a
family I've always wanted to work for a
company that felt like a family I mean
so we thought these debates are so
interesting let's take them to the rest
of the company and so before we would
codify you know whatever was in our
PowerPoint presentation literally
everybody in the company would have had
a chance to look at it read it talk
about it make suggestions make edits you
know I remember one time later on it's
in the later part of that I had
recommended that people go interview
right because I do I think it's a really
great way if you're unhappy to find out
what it is you're unhappy about go tell
a stranger and somebody in the company
came to me and said how do you guys
expect anybody to get anything done when
you and Reid if they're told everybody
they should spend all their time
interviewing you know nobody's going to
get any work done
please you know I just walked through a
period there are hundreds of people they
are so or are you upset with how it's
written right and I knew that she was
upset with the idea that people on her
team would go out and I knew that she
felt cheated on right and would you know
sidebar when I talked to women's groups
now I say look when they talk about
engagement nobody put a ring on it
and interviewing is not cheating on your
husband
it's a really smart thing to do so she
said no no it's not it's PowerPoint
chapter by chapter the chapter on
high-performance
writing high-performance didn't take
very long to write in my own team I
would have to say it took four years to
put together the mechanisms to make it
so right so I had to have a really great
recruiting team that really understood
the business and the teams and could
could find fabulous people for the work
that we were going to do not just the
work that we were doing so I had to like
I hired my best headhunters and brought
him inside and paid them what they made
with bonuses as a mentor and they saved
me money your crazy idea I had to put
together get rid of the idea performance
improvement plans and figure out what
our severance policy was going to be I
had to spend years reprogramming
managers who came from other companies
to have open and honest conversations
about about work with people because
most of those times they would come in
and say you know I'm having a problem
with one of my people caddy for HR take
care of it and I would you know shut up
and out the door and go I'm not managing
your team you are right I do a lot of
tips on that step two but basically so
so we wrote a chapter we tried to make
it real when we made it real when we had
a company with a very high density of
very talented adults who were were
performing that that's when we could
write freedom and responsibility right
we couldn't do that until we had a whole
bunch of people that we trusted to do
that and then once we wrote freedom and
responsibility then we couldn't write
the next chapter right then we could
start talking about how compensation
really works right then we could start
talking about all of those things so
that entire deck that you have in your
hand was our internal onboarding
document the honest truth is we would
when 10 15 people would join the company
reading I would sit in a room with that
on a story and just go through the deck
had padded that how we did and okay it's
a bit but better story we're driving to
work rent a read my car pulls together
and he said I met this woman last night
at a dinner he has this really cool new
company they put PowerPoint slides
online right and I said it's called
SlideShare but they're doing PowerPoint
slides online I said oh that is a great
idea I wish I hadn't thought of that
I wonder what people are going to
publish you said oh I put the deck out
this movie humankind I don't even think
the fonts are the same chapter two
chapping at the little arrow slides
it's just graphically it is you never
told me that set you and and I said
secondly you're gonna scare off all my
candidates and he said only the ones we
don't want patty this discussion is so
valuable I I wish we could take more
time I want to ask a couple more
questions first you're right
this PowerPoint Beck is not it's not
very visually appealing but it's
deliberate it's prophetic in terms of
when you look at it but I reread it last
night and it's wildly available Google
you know Netflix culture deck or patio
Accord culture that gets everywhere been
downloaded probably ten million times
literally and this program will probably
add a million downloads to it when I
looked at it again last night I looked
at it less to the lens of an executive
officer at Franklin Covey which I am
thinking about our culture I looked at
it to the lens of my own maturity or
immaturity my own level of engagement
without a ring with the ring and I was a
bit humbled as I looked at some of the
pieces around selflessness and making
sure that I'm putting the firm first
recognizing that you know I'm here for
the
firm but I'm also here from my own
career my own skills talk about some
briefly some of the most passionate
pieces in here that you think could give
some advice to people's own level of
maturity and in contribution yeah I
think that the selfless part is also
tied to company first you know it it's
you it's something like I said earlier
Reid says we're never fully formed you
know adults are always seeking more
forming and and that's part of it it's
it's that constant learning about who
you are and how you operate with others
and the selflessness comes from
understanding as you grow as a leader
that you get more done by having amazing
people around you that do I mean I told
you I had dinner with Reid not too long
ago and I said so what he ought to these
days class and he said I make almost no
decisions and I'm so proud of it like
the teams are so confident and they're
so capable all over the world it's just
like he's like I go to bed at night not
no longer proud of like oh I made the
right call on that one and more like wow
we've got a great leader in that
organization and they're making the
right call and so you know I think for
me over the years it's been looking at
and teaching other leaders like the way
for you to get ahead is to surround
yourself with people that can make a
huge difference to your organization how
do I think the last discussion point is
something I'm especially intrigued about
and it comes from your pragmatism you're
you're an uber realist and you're very
wise in your season and you made
mistakes and you've had successes you
mentioned it briefly earlier we talked
about interviewing you talked really
real about letting people go meaning if
they want to leave let them leave don't
try to hold people hostage talk a little
about a little bit about your philosophy
on building a culture where it's okay if
you leave and you're not shamed we
want you to be happy if you're not happy
here no problem yeah I have I call it my
algorithm for success it goes like this
I use the word algorithm because I've
been surrounded by geeks it says is what
you love to do that you're
extraordinarily good at doing something
we need someone to be great at and that
changes over time for you and for the
firm Yeah right sometimes you go to a
company and you take a job because you
want to learn how to do something and
you want to be surrounded by people who
are better at than you so that they can
teach you so you could be better and
then you get better and you want to
solve a bigger problem right I mean I
see it all the time in particularly in
the tech world because that's where I
spend a lot of time in people who really
like building stuff and so they want to
and they want their problems that
they're so going to get more and more
complex and complicated and so in order
to do that you kind of have to go to a
bigger firm sometimes because that's
where problems are bigger than work all
right so the startup world doesn't last
forever
startups don't last forever so you know
I think it's just I think it's 50% of it
as us as employees as people I like it
when before we got started I don't have
the best life now it is so fun you know
I really love having a lot of freedom
now and I loved being an employee and I
think now more than ever there's so many
ways to work and that we should think
about as we go through our careers in
our whole lives about not just changing
companies as it were but changing the
way work and who you work with and how
you do it maybe it's a non-profit and
then it's a for-profit
I don't know but those are all we all
have lots of different ways we can
explore that now and I just think it's a
lot more fun and it's more realistic
patty I almost never do this in fact I
don't think I've ever done it on air but
before we started taping you talked a
bit about the role that dr. Covey and
his work in the seven Habits and how it
influenced your life what's the biggest
lesson you learned from dr. stephen
r.covey the co-founder of our firm and
how it shaped the way you think about
the world yourself cultures and now I
told you earlier I think for me
personally and for my work it's been the
idea of big rocks and so Kobe talks
about you know we can fill our lives
with all these little things the endless
emails or the phone calls or the
conversations just all this little stuff
that comes with every day that we got to
get it done we've got to get it done
we've got to get it done and the
metaphor he uses is if you fill a bucket
with sand and then you can try and put
folders in they don't fit because it's
full sand right but if you put the big
rocks in first the stuff that's most
important then you can pour the sand in
and it'll fill in all the cracks and
crevices and so it's it's a it's a
visual that represents prioritization
and reflecting on what's really
important to you and what's important to
the company when I had a coach companies
now my advice and I say look strategy is
not what you're going to do that's
called planning strategy is what you
don't do right so you have to find those
big things that you must do and get
those done first and so I would say that
that's the part I remember most that I
still use in my life and my work
everyday Patti you're Jim thank you for
your contribution what's your favorite
net fix a Netflix program I know you
weren't on the programming side you make
that quite clear what's the program you
like the best it's the Queen
I'm still mourning the end of orange is
the new black stranger things is
hysterical so you know
I could cut the cord for a thousand
years until my husband deciding when it
sports back so as soon as somebody does
his Sports streaming services I don't
know you know I I'll leave you with
we were we used to listen to the
blockbuster earnings call on a Polycom
in a conference room and we'd all sit
around the table and listen you remember
I remember when Louis asked John ante up
at the scene of blockbuster what he
thought that was and he said they are
Annette they are nothing no one cares
they will never ever succeed don't ask
me about them anymore and I remember on
the whiteboard behind our CMO was our
subscriber numbers you know just just
going up into the riot and with and I
remember seeing it was bold Patti McCord

How Netflix Destroyed Blockbuster Video
one of the most revolutionary products
ever written was the hundred and twenty
one pace culture of Netflix you have to
see the future in ways that other people
can't
Patty who was read at that time here's a
geeky engineer so there's a methodology
I want to teach you that will encompass
when to fire when to fire you hire I
have a hard time with companies that
still do five year planning you know
that you're just making up the other
three years right that's why I know what
we do well let's dance let me let me ask
the question let me ask a question cuz I
wanna go specific do you know the
company are going up against through a
blockbuster and one of the analysts
asked of the CEO of blockbuster what do
you think of Netflix stop asking me
about that stupid little company love
them they are an at they are no one no
one will ever use this stuff what does
he owe me to you you're the breadwinner
of this family you've gotta grow up read
if you want to follow then god damn it
leave Wow
[Music]
when I read her book it's called
powerful antibodies read it in here yet
you've already read it some of you guys
hurt you speaking powerful if you are in
a business with employees recruiting
hiring firing HR you want to find out
how to create a winning culture you have
to read this book all-powerful I'll tell
you right now on believable book when I
read it and I've read 1500 books so I
read this book and I'm going through it
and you see Sheryl Sandberg talk about
the fact that one of the most
revolutionary products ever written
written in Silicon Valley was the
hundred and twenty one page thing that
they came up with the culture of Netflix
her and Reed Hastings together they
created this culture the website with
this presentation of what their culture
has been built does anybody know how
many people clicked on this website to
read their culture anybody knows the
number fifteen million people it got 15
million clicks by the way you know who
clicks on an article like this that has
to do with HR and culture people that
are info there's not 15 million people
that are interested in HR is 15 million
people that are in that world like
yourself and as you go through the
process and unpack the kind of culture
they built it's very controversial very
different she may say it's normal to her
but it's very different than most people
that's why I wanted to bring her down
for us to sit down with her and see how
she went from being at Netflix 14 years
helping the company with the team
members that they had read and everybody
else build the company from zero to
going up against the company at that
time blockbuster that was an eight
billion dollar company and now Netflix
is the powerhouse of our nearly a
hundred and fifty billion dollar company
please help me bring up patty McCord
[Applause]
hi thanks for coming out I mean you have
to make your work
thank you
all right
so Patti what I hear is the fact that
you're at a different event you're
speaking at that event you took a quick
flight to come you got to get back to
the event I did is that really we had a
flat tire planes with flat tires
literally well I'm glad whoever changed
the flat tires is here they probably
called the triple-a I don't know planes
go xxx yes yeah I was really fascinated
by your story and what you build
literally when I started going through
I'm like and maybe part of it was
because I'm going through right now with
hiring an HR person and we're going
through that culture but the timing was
so perfect why I'm like people need to
know about the kind of culture you guys
built so one is before we go through the
story of you know what's happened what's
taking place with the business on how
Netflix became the success story that it
is maybe let's go back at the infancy
stages of the business while you guys
were first going through it you know
beginning stages while you're working
with Reed Hastings you know did you guys
really know what you had was it like yes
we're gonna one day do it was a vision
what was it okay let me tell you the
priests story because it's a good story
Reed and I worked together at another
company which was a software tools
company Reed was an engineer he wrote
the original prod product we grew
through merger and acquisition in the
five years we were together we went
public and acquired four other companies
every company that we acquired was twice
as when we got together we were twice as
big so we were 100 people 200 400 800
1600 and then we got acquired by our
largest competitor and honestly it was
my first big HR job I started out as a
recruiter and and Reed hired me because
it was the only skill he thought was
actually necessary in HR it was like all
that other stuff is [ __ ] but your
recruiter saw I'll hire you so he flat
out said that to you he flat out said
that to me after he hired me probably
wouldn't have taken the job if he hadn't
so we sold the company I read made a
bunch of money and he invested in a
bunch of startups and one of them was
Netflix and for those of you hora in the
US anybody use dvd-by-mail okay so the
first product was so
so he calls me up in the middle and I
and I knew about the idea because he had
told me about it he says are you
sleeping and I said yeah geek I'm normal
it's 2:00 in the morning
and he said I'm gonna go run Netflix and
I said sounds like a great career move
you go for it big guy
and he said well I want you to come too
and I'm like Ian no I need to go back to
sleep because first of all who's gonna
use this product there's only I only
knew for people that had DVD players
they cost $1500 right and so I'm like
what's your since my since 94 is this
ninety six seven I said four you know
I'm consulting my kids know my name I'm
having a pretty good time don't ask me
to do a start-up with you I know what
you're talking about go call a stranger
and say startup would be fun but and
third of all this is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard and he said I'll make it
compelling I'll make it so that you
can't say no and I said there isn't a
possible thing you could say to me and
he said what if we build a company that
was really successful and we loved
working there and we we just built the
kind of company we wanted to work in
okay now I'm awake and I said well how
do you know my question if we did that
how would you know and he said oh I'd
want to walk in the door and solve these
problems with these people every day I'm
like damn that's good
and he said how about you how'd you know
and I said wouldn't it be great if we
were a great place to be from like
having netflix on your resumes meant
something because i was in i didn't I'm
a recruiter right like you were at Apple
Wow
you know so I didn't know at that time
how profound my statement was because
when you build a company that is a great
place to be from and you say that you
want it full of people who when they
leave which most people do that they
walk away saying god that was it I I did
something that was an unbelievable with
people that I really loved working with
I accomplished something that people use
right
and so you know I had two that was
compelling but the beginning was you
know we were blockbuster online we had
due dates and late fees we couldn't get
any content nobody would sell us
anything we bought DVDs at Walmart I
would go to Walmart with my shopping
cart and fill it full of DVDs it really
it was bad yeah let me ask at that time
a patty who was read at that time like
meaning what kind of repetition did he
have with you of working with them well
the we had solved the company that we
were in together for quite a bit of
money and so we made the investors a lot
of money so it was pretty golden in
terms of rainmaking but in terms of the
man I knew you know when I met him he
was I would have to lecture him in the
morning and say look if you're gonna
sleep under your desk please get the
fuzz out of the beard in the morning
because it looks tacky right he was a he
was a geeky engineer and his
transformation to a great leader was
when he realized I caught him one night
this is at the first company I caught
him one night I walked in it's like
seven o'clock at night he's at his
computer you know in the glow of its
computer and I said oh are you working
on the slides for the company meeting
tomorrow he's like yeah that's what I'm
working on I walked behind him and I
said you're bug fixing you found a bug
in the software and you're working eyes
like well somebody's got to do it I'm
like yeah somebody's got like how about
these people that we hired to do it you
have a big speech tomorrow read if you
want to follow then god dammit lead Wow
and I stomped at was this prior this is
not Netflix at that time is he no no no
Martin like does he have a name like he
is read like do they look at him as no
it's just another Silicon Valley I mean
he successfully made a bunch of money
and so that makes you famous right
having a successful IPO is important
he's not famous like he is now and that
so so at Netflix like what was different
was we both made a commitment to each
other that we would try to create some
the best possible place we could and we
didn't mean people were happy right
because I'm not very touchy-feely you
can read it my book
but he's ever called me touchy or feely
but you have people hug you when they
left him people cried when they saw you
a couple years later after work you know
I used to do when I first started
speaking I would do a lot of talking
about how your employees aren't your
family and you shouldn't use the word
family and then when people meet me they
say and they read my book and they meet
me and they say you know I hope you're
not offended but you're pretty nice like
I kind of didn't expect you to be nice
and I didn't expect you to be warm and
you know I'm the queen of the good
goodbye and I think you can say goodbye
to people with affection and grace and
dignity and I'm really really good at it
and so what I now say is my lifelong
friends are from work right I mean I
would trust my children's lives with the
people I've worked with at Netflix but
it wasn't but it's not a family and it
wasn't always fun that's why you know
like I've been crazy when I love Netflix
I was sort of at the beginning of this
whole San Francisco startup scene and I
would go into all every single office
was really cool and every single office
had plants and every single office was
open and every single office had a
bartender right I'm like really you
raised you know you raised this much
money in your second round and you're
spending it by putting a bartender on
payroll and they're like you know we're
worried we might have some issues of
sexual harassment like you'd think you
got a bar at work and I would talk to
people and they would say you know it's
our job in HR to make people happy and I
would give them this assignment I'll
give you this assignment find two three
people in your organization that are
amazing you know who they are right the
people that really accomplish amazing
stuff and ask them to tell you a story
about tell me about the thing that
you're most proud of right something
that you accomplished that you really
thought made a difference and every
single story will be about something
hard right and so my fundamental belief
is what makes us happy at work so
powerful is accomplishing things it's
always when you go man we didn't think
we could do that we sure didn't think we
could do it by that deadline but we did
right and and it would and the stories
are also always about team efforts right
it's always a we right and if the
persons and I person you probably don't
want to hire me anyway because all of
your companies all of the things that
you're doing it's a team effort so
that's what I just fundamentally believe
and so I find him I really believe that
and then it took me until Netflix so
that was a long way in my career I'm an
old lady to realize that you could
actually build a company with adults and
I don't mean old you know because all of
you know really mature twenty year olds
and we all know really immature forty
year olds right and so we started sort
of screening for adult behavior and so
if you hire people who are adults and
they're smart and they care and they can
and you expect a lot from them it goes
pretty right so let's start with that
let's Alyssa because there's a few
things I'd like to accomplish with this
sit down we have together
one is recruiting two is when it's time
to go three years repositioning and
putting people in better places but the
most important one to start off with is
I mean for Sheryl to say what she said
about what you guys came up with
we're got 15 million hits yeah that's
pretty wild right here's the back story
of the Netflix culture Dec tell us
so when Reed and I went to Netflix the
thing that we vowed to each other that
would be different was we would we would
actively control the culture as much as
we could we would be deliberate about it
we wouldn't let it happen and so what we
would do in order to do that as we'd
write it down so at the time read was a
guy who thought in PowerPoint he does
outlines right so PowerPoint is good for
him and so he said let's have an off
site and we're going to talk about
values and I said let's not we've got a
business to figure out and it's usually
just an esoteric waste of time you know
and Ron said integrity and they carved
in marble and they didn't mean it so I
don't want to do that like tell me what
to put on a t-shirt we'll buy some
t-shirts I don't care and I said but you
know what I will do I will write down
behaviors let's write down like if we
say integrity we need to say this is
what it looks like this is
but you act like when you have integrity
and this is what it looks like when you
don't and if you don't you don't work
here anymore it's gonna be that
straightforward so we did that and if
you those of you have ever seen the
Netflix culture deck that's the first
part of it we rewrote that section seven
times because we would what we do is
we'd get back with all the leaders of
our team and we'd say okay let's go
through this name a person that's doing
this name a person that's doing this
name and if we couldn't we would say is
that a value that really matters is that
a behavior that we care is that are we
true - okay that's chapter one okay
in the year 2000 we were gonna go public
we were pitching our IP on Sand Hill
Road we were drinking champagne and
eating caviar and we're gonna have a
hundred dollars stock and private jets
because pets.com did and webbed and did
and so it was our turn I mean after all
and we were gonna be a portal we were
gonna be sell ads and movie stars and
we're gonna be everything entertainment
and the bubble burst and the bankers
pulled the IPO and we didn't make it
is this a town where you lost that dough
to your employees yeah so the but this
is when we laid off 30 percent of the
workforce yeah so it was we ran out of
money and so we had one chance to make
it we really gonna the business was
gonna be a subscription business right
so we had to build a base and every
marketing dollar that we spent acquiring
a new customer was a dollar that was
lost because it didn't come back in the
subscription for many months actually so
I said goodbye to anybody whose job it
was to tell somebody else what to do all
of middle management anybody who wasn't
technically competent to work on
dvd-by-mail only anybody who was a baby
or a whiner because I just couldn't I
couldn't tell the guy who complained
about the color of his t-shirt that we
literally didn't have any money left for
t-shirts so we did that it was a it was
very difficult for us but that Christmas
so now it's 2001
DVD players drop to $99 if you're in the
u.s. you had one under your Christmas
tree and in that DVD player box was a
coupon that said try netflix for free
and our business went how'd you get that
contract you know which I I went into
Best Buy what boxes stuffed in envelopes
because we got a deal with Best Buy that
they would let us do it in certain DVD
player box so you so wait a minute let
me get this straight you guys put that
in there yeah yeah we're scrappy baby
we're scrappy I mean we're all scrappy
stuff you know and we cuz we couldn't we
couldn't put him in in China he can
afford the plane ticket to China it's
great so business takes off and by the
way I'm still thinking about that's
insane
did you guys that's insane that's great
love it yeah okay but yeah we knew when
we were doing well because we didn't
have a bartender it's when I went over
with my shopping cart and got beer that
wasn't in cans to celebrate something
okay so business is going crazy we're
working harder than we've ever worked
Reid and I are driving to work one day
and I'm like I've never worked this hard
in my life he goes me too I'm like I've
never had this much fun in my life and
he goes me too
what is it let's figure it out right and
so we realize everybody is so focused
and everybody and and here's how we
would win right this is the only hope we
had was to make our products so much
better that you'd get addicted to it
that you wouldn't ever want to give it
up right and so the only metric that
mattered was our customer and we knew
that they liked it because they stayed
because it was a subscription service
right
and so we had to constantly constantly
improve improve improve improve and
inside of the company we started
changing the way we communicated with
each other where if anybody would opine
about something or have
yeah or disagree with something it kind
of whatever the sentence was it had to
end with because it affects the customer
right if you're being a jerk and my team
doesn't want to work with you then
that's really problematic because we're
wasting a bunch of time and we got to
get make this feature for our customer
as soon as we can right because this is
a really thing that they'll really want
but so it was like comma for the
customer okay so that's when we wrote
the chapter in the culture deck called
high performance and that's when we
described what we thought were
high-performing people adults smart good
judgment make the right call would be
able to go out and talk to other people
on the team to be able to be good team
players then when I and it probably took
me four years to create the systems to
actually have high performance people
would say that to create systems yeah
really great recruiting team and I had
to have an and I and if I if the
business changed if I hired you to build
something and two years in you had built
it and you were done and now I needed
you to maintain it and you don't want to
maintain it you're a builder I'm not
gonna put you on a performance
improvement plan you're performing right
over time I would realize that I could
just say I think you're done so what do
you want to do here because we only had
one product I couldn't send him
somewhere else in the company right and
so I what are you instead of doing a 90
day performance and performance
improvement plans now this took me years
that's why I'm telling you it took me
years eventually I could say I don't
think this is gonna work out here's
three months pay you want to work on
your next great job right so I'm gonna
segue into a lesson I want to teach you
about this but but so then we wrote high
performance so the Netflix culture deck
took ten years to write because it took
ten years to figure it out so another
day we're driving to read my car pulled
a lot he says I met this woman last
night
created this really cool company they
put PowerPoint decks on the Internet I
said that is such a great idea I wonder
what people are gonna put out there and
he said oh I put the deck up it was an
internal onboarding document we didn't
write that to be a viral treatise on how
to run your company we wrote it so that
when you join Netflix we could say oh by
the way we should tell you how it works
around here and I freaked out okay so
anybody seen the Netflix culture deck
that PowerPoint presentation it's ugly
as sin I said oh god read it so the
graphics
I mean arrows and the yin and yang you
know people kind of loved it because it
was so dorky he said you never told me
it was dorky I'm like yeah I didn't want
to hurt your feelings and and then I
said you're gonna scare all our
candidates because in the culture deck
it says adequate performance gets a
generous severance package and he said
only the ones we don't want but what it
did for us was it made our interviewing
process really rich because we didn't
just talk about were you qualified for
the job we talked about how do you like
to work what kind of team player are you
what's important to you where are you at
in your career right is it is it title
that you're chasing right now because we
don't have any I mean I called seniors
I've called people senior software
engineers they're like you have one
title for software engineers what's the
salary range like oh like 72 seven
hundred thousand how do you know you're
senior I'm like oh you know you know you
know right okay so that's how the
culture deck was written that's how it
was not we didn't release it that's how
it went viral we had no clue that people
would pick it up like they did a crazy
the reason why I wrote my book was that
when I left Netflix every CEO in the
world would throw the culture deck down
say I want to do this and I would say by
the way newsflash it took 10 years to
write and so I wrote my book and my book
is like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Netflix culture deck so there's a
methodology I want to teach you all of
you that will encompass when to fire
to fire who to hire but that that I
think is really helpful and it's this
imagine your team six months from now
and I think six months is a really good
amount of time because our businesses
move so fast now I have a hard time with
companies that still do five-year
planning I'm like you know that you're
just making up the other three years
right we all know that right
so let's say in six months you have a
team that is amazing not better amazing
like your competitors the other people
around you're like oh my god these
people I can't believe what they're
accomplishing and I want you to write
down what's going to be occurring then
that's not occurring now you can give me
all your numerals if you're a metrics
person is it more customers is it better
retention is it a better quality
software is a better customer experience
whatever that is right and give me all
those numbers but then walk around your
company and make a movie of it I can't
help it I'm from Netflix right and you
make a movie of it like if it was
optimal with there being more meetings
or would there be less meetings would
there be people who stand up and go it
sounds like what they're doing its
marketing is crazy I'm gonna go ask them
why instead of going the people in
marketing you're crazy you know right
what's occurring then that's not
occurring now because I want to give you
I want you to think about those
behaviors and and for smaller companies
very often the problems that you reach
when you actually are going to be
successful are no longer problems of
difficulty they're problems of scale or
complexity right so in six months you
might need somebody who really knows how
to take this rocket ship and really make
it successful and everybody you have on
your team's been there since the
beginning but they don't know anything
about a hundred times okay so we got
that you got that rent out now drop down
a level and go huh what would people
need to know how to do in order to
accomplish that in six months very
important that we put time wrappers on
this because otherwise as leaders of
companies especially small companies we
get caught in the trap
of some day right and we tell people you
know you yeah you could do it you could
be CFO someday rock on you do it you can
do that right you say that but no people
do you told me I could be CFO and I say
yeah but you're an Accounts Payable
Clerk right you know that you can't be
CFO now why not
so Suleiman let me get this straight so
you're saying you guys didn't say
something that's well let's think let me
let me ask the question let me ask the
question cuz I wanna go specific so so I
say I can't be a I asked you a question
hey one day I'd like to be a CFO yep and
I'm Accounts Payable
yep what do you tell me I say have you
thought about a reasonable and rational
timeframe to accomplish that right and
you say well there's a CFO opening here
and I'm I'd like to be qualified for it
and I say you're not because here's what
the qualifications for a CFO would be in
a public company so there's you know you
don't know anything about tax you don't
know anything about audit you don't know
so these are all things that you will
learn in your career let's just be
realistic about the timeframe okay so
back to my methodology
okay now I'm six months out what do you
need to know how to do then you drop
down say what kind of skills and
experience would it take for somebody
know how to do that in order to
accomplish that in six months and then
and only then who's on your team now
right and if you start with who's on
your team now and you extrapolate out
you'll you'll do more you'll get better
but you might not get as good as you
could if you didn't articulate the
endgame so when you have that
articulation this is what it's going to
look like these are the problems now you
can go wow this is a problem that nobody
on the team knows how to solve
that's who you hire right and so now you
haven't written a job description
because job descriptions are dumb I mean
I'm in recruiting I know here's what job
description is it's either a description
of somebody who left that you wish
hadn't a fantasy person that doesn't
exist or whatever it takes to get it
approved none of those are who you hire
you want to hire somebody who can solve
this problem that you have in a fairly
short amount of time
and so now when you're recruiting you're
not only recruiting for somebody who's
qualified but you're recruiting for
somebody who goes oh man
I'd love to do that the other thing is
it leaves you open to a lot of different
ways of solving the problem because
otherwise what people tend to do is say
I want to hire something with these
qualifications and I want them to be
really smart and quick on their feet and
intelligent charismatic like someone
like me
maybe me 10 years ago and that's we hire
and like hires like hires like Cara
slack and then you wonder why you don't
have any diversity and any diversity of
thought and you don't have anybody who
knows how to solve a problem that nobody
in the team already knows hot dog okay
so that's how you figure out who to hire
in the same way sometimes when you do
those problems you realize oh oh the
team I have is not the team to do that
so here's my Netflix story we've grown
30% this is what after where things are
going good right this is probably around
2010 right and at this point you've been
there 13 years yeah I've been there a
long time our team is really tied we're
rocking it man this reads on the cover
of Fortune ii CEO the year stock has
grown you know the business has grown
30% quarter over quarter three quarters
in the row
I mean it's we're awesome right so we do
it a session in our executive staff and
I and I said what if this kept up like
because the Britos wants to do disaster
playing I'm like why don't just for once
like what if what if it kept up so CFO
goes the whiteboard and he does top-line
revenue 30% core and so he starts doing
that happy dance let's see if I mean you
can you imagine for those of you who are
the finance people you'd be like so Ted
or a head of content we at the time we
would say to ourselves someday we'll be
as big as HBO someday
and Ted looks at the number and he goes
it's next year right and we just look at
each other like stun and Neil who is our
head of product said I think that's a
third of the US Internet bandwidth I
think we could be streaming a third of
the US Internet bandwidth and we all
just kinda liked each other like so he
and I get together I'm like do we have
anybody that knows how to do that
because know like can we do that in our
data center
oh no no no must be in the cloud so we
sit down with our IT team and these guys
are amazing they're amazing and we lay
out the problem and they're like no
worries you go exec something and we'll
build a cloud and I said you know what
if there's any people in the room
anybody on earth that could do that it's
probably you guys not 9 months we could
stand up the servers right we couldn't
leased the physical space and buy the
equipment and do it and so one of the
people in the room said I've been here
for seven years we wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for me are you telling me I
might not be on this team and I said
yeah I think that's what I'm telling you
and but we got nine months to figure it
out and you know even though people
didn't like that answer it was true and
I've worked with engineers forever and
engineers have the engineers think the
world is good or bad right or wrong
black or white zero one right so it was
like I'm not sure I like that answer but
I can't deny the truth of it and so what
the AHA of that lesson is it's your job
if you're running an organization to
field the team that can win and you
never want to let the talent or lack of
talent in your organization come between
you and what success looks like that's
pretty wild what you just said can you
say that one more time if you're in
charge of running an organization it's
your job to feel the team here's your
dog to create amazing tea
that do incredible work on time with
quality that served the customer period
and the finish it's never to allow the
talent to come in between you and what
your opportunity that's unbelievable
right there so it has your personality
always been like this yeah you're in let
me know if it's this read is read like
you as well yeah here's known that I'm
at the geek part here's what I'm talking
about because the part says you know
when I start speaking HR speak when I
first met him about six months he's like
did you just say anything but that noise
that you made did that like can you tell
me how'd you guys meet in the first
place how'd you go where'd you guys meet
oh this funny story so I was working at
a company called Borland it was a
suffered company and I was working with
one of the company was kind of falling
apart because Microsoft was killing it
and what a view piece that I worked with
his deciding he was a Harvard MBA
whether to go back to Harvard and teach
or go to a startup and so I helped
career counsel and then he went to this
started and I called him up about some
stock or something one time I'm like hey
how'd your new HR guy work out and he
said oh man he was an idiot we fired him
it's just been bad he tells me the story
I'm like oh great well you can hire me
and he said you told me if if I hired
anybody from Borland you'd break both my
legs I said yeah I didn't mean me so he
said I can't do it I told the CEO I
wouldn't recruit anybody out there the
CEOs name is Reed Hastings good luck
so those of you who were old enough back
in the day you could dial star-69 and it
would call back and read sister answered
the phone and I said hi I'm Patti McCord
I'm friends with Rob dickerson can I
speak please speak with Reed Hastings
and she that's literally out and what
did the conversation sound like oh we
got this huge argument because now
remember back in those days I could
still speak it has a difficult site your
personality like there's a consensus
there's a part of you that's difficult
oh yeah okay so he asked me in the
interview tell me about your HR
philosophy Reid I believe in empowering
employees to reach their
so that they can align themselves with
the organizational structure and their
own desires and careers to accomplish
well you know I go into full on HR speak
right burning platforms and he looks me
because people like why do I have to
have somebody like you and my business
you don't speak English honestly that's
how I felt I'm trying to see how you
don't know me yeah I guess well how am I
supposed to know you when you're so I'm
like oh yeah well I know how to do some
things that are pretty darn important
around here right he's like oh yeah like
what I'm like well I'm a hell of a
recruiter and I'm really good with
engineers he's like oh yeah well that
might matter so I go home I go home my
now ex-husband says how'd it go with CEO
and he's like you're the breadwinner of
this family you've got to grow up and
act like a real HR person you're never
gonna get another job
that's how you got started the
relationship so what what what makes an
ideal relationship with the CEO on the
HR so what what makes it effective like
what is the is it very open is it
constant daily communication even if you
hire a traditional HR person you've got
to get them to unlearn that crazy
language that they talk because it's
really stupid and I'm doing a lot for
you in that vein I talked to a lot of HR
people and sometimes I don't want to but
you know I say the doors close it's just
us I'm one of you you got to stop using
a language that nobody knows where that
but us the language you must speak is
the language of the business so don't
put anybody in the role who it doesn't
deeply understand your business they
should be able to read a P&L and they
should be able to derive from that
business plan exactly what the team
structure should look like that's their
added value HR people HR has three
components as far as I'm concerned one
of them is staffing staffing is really
really critical and staffing is your job
it's not HR job if you have a great
partnership with your recruiting or your
staffing team then you'll find the right
talent but finding the right talent for
your team is a job that you do all the
time did I say all the time all the time
your job meaning CEO your job absolutely
okay it is your job it's your job to be
scouting for talent constantly and it's
your job to do that because you set the
example for everybody else in your
organization that it's their job to
build great teams and they can't build
great teams if they rely on a bunch of
people in HR that they think are stupid
okay question for you give me some
examples on how you saw read constantly
looking for talent seventy one time and
I said I know her he goes yeah she's a
head of HR Yahoo Yahoo I'm here he's
like you can get hit by a bus look
that's a good point and he's like I just
you know wanted to see what other people
are doing see if there's anything we
should try what year of your career was
this Oh at this point I was pretty
confident you know because read it asked
me to come to Netflix oh no no meaning
this one when this was different way
20-something problem no no no not in
your what year of Netflix was it was it
was it like 50 or 40 okay so the only
person donors I'm asking this question
you said your job CEO you said Scout and
you're always scouting what were some
ways that Reid was scouting for talent
just wherever in a meeting like this to
meet you you know it's and very often my
experience is a recruiter in all these
years when I coach people about looking
for work I say it's not what you know or
who you know it's who knows what you
know so every person that you meet is a
conduit to somebody else so for example
in my team I'm like we give good
interview I'm telling you we want every
single person that walks in here to walk
on go god I hope they hire me even if we
hate them because we want them to do you
know to be at their kids soccer match
and say to the dad next to them what do
you do oh you know why it's just
interviewing at Netflix and I wasn't the
right person but you sounds like you
might be
should I tell them about you right so
that's mine recruiting my earlier I'm a
very good technical recruiter so in
Silicon Valley this probably happens
wherever you are the engineers had this
habit of like there is the ethnic
restaurant dejour we're all eating Thai
food or you know it's all about Korean
barbeque and they're always these little
hole-in-the-wall restaurants in a next
to a nail salon and a strip mall and I
find out where those restaurants were
and so in those restaurants they have a
like fishbowl you put your business card
in you get a free lunch so I'd walk in
and take the fishbowl whose before
cellphones right in the internet they go
to a table in the back corner I'd dump
oh man I just start writing gun names go
back and call now so so so God gave you
LinkedIn yeah so right God gave you
social networking okay so that's
staffing the next component of HR is the
administrative and compliance component
that's payroll and benefits and all the
legal labor law stuff that stuff is
really really important you want people
in those roles who really really love
accuracy you want them to wake up in the
middle of an I can go I spelled your
name wrong you want them to know all the
rules you don't want them to make any
their answer to can we as always know
right so but that's okay you need
somebody to know what those things are
so I put that in Netflix eventually in
finance or in legal the dilemma of
putting that's because those guys
sometimes don't have the best customer
service so it's an internal thing then
the third component is the component
about organizational structure and
design leadership coaching the being
honest with being I call it being a
mirror to your organization so you have
to know the business and you have to
know what your values are and you have
to be able to say truthfully to anybody
in the organization I think we could do
better right and you have to be able to
honestly for me I mean I'm I practice a
lot so I could say to somebody bring
them in the room and close the door and
go you know you're kind of an [ __ ]
and I'm not gonna tolerate I know reeds
in love with you and I know you're
brilliant and I know you also want to be
a VP when you grow up so here's the deal
VP's run teams VP's who run the
effective teams are ineffective teams
because people want to work for them and
do great work and nobody wants to work
with you they don't like you they don't
like to be a meetings with you they'd
get bummed when they're put on your team
you got to change that dude because
that's what's gonna make success for you
I'll help you because I'd really like
you to not be an [ __ ] it'd be a
brilliant guy that can contribute to our
company he's still very sick what's next
I'll help you what does that mean what's
next for me no you said I'll help you if
you want to be a VP one day but you
can't be one being an [ __ ]
yeah so when you say I'll help you what
is that help I need that help for two
this course was for me to see him see
his team in a meeting walk in the room
and sit down
he's like Patti what are you doing here
my in the neighborhood just thought and
then I would I would say Todd excuse me
but you're doing it right now
cuz he didn't know he's like yeah I've
gotten that feedback before I'm like but
you didn't do anything about it so most
people who have did really got as well
or now but was that your role no no
meaning yes that assigned to you or he
did it as well I work together for 25
years so you know this is a long long
time we could but but we worked really
hard on he and I modeling the kind of
relationship we wanted other people to
have so we would so we used to go in the
early days we took the company to the
Sundance Film Festival that was our
annual event and every year Reid and I
would have a bottle of wine together got
progressively better by the way that
bottle of wine and the bottle went
together that we would have would be the
discussion which would say Nick what's
on what's on our plates for next year
and am I still the right person what's
on our plate mix here and are you still
the right person or if he's still the
right person like what do you think our
strengths and weaknesses are going to be
next year so for example when
have a dvd-by-mail business I said you
know read I think we're gonna have we
could have like 5,000 employees and I
think 4,000 of them are gonna work in
warehouses and drive cars you know drive
trucks and put DVDs into envelopes I
think we're gonna have a lot of
blue-collar direct labor at work for us
and he's like yeah I could see that I'm
like I don't know what minimum wage is
hmm I mean I've so far away from this
kind of workforce
I had just I'm not your gal to do this
like I don't do we have to do they have
to be bonded I mean what are the rules
around this kind of worker and he goes
yeah you'd probably suck at that and I
said yeah I probably wouldn't he was but
then if we got somebody who for whom
there was that was their expertise they
probably would suck at relating to
engineers and that's really critical to
our business at the time like yeah it's
true he goes well let's do a six-month
plan you go see if you can find somebody
to do that to work for you who can teach
us both about how we manage that kind of
work for something okay deal right and
then I would say to him by the way you
know you keep you sort of by default
keep flowing into this role where we
can't keep an executive and honestly we
need to find somebody who really owns
this and not you anymore all right cuz
that's gonna hurt us right so tell me
what you mean by you can't keep
executives it was a stitch I forget what
the role was but it was like if there
wasn't anybody in marketing then he'd
run it or data science right the data
science guy wasn't there so they would
report to him I'm like you know really
not helpful for you to run a function
because we kind of would like you to go
CEO something
what does CEO mean to you so what is the
CEO job a good seal what is it what is
she you know has a couple of great
characteristics one of them is you you
have a you're very smart
good CEOs have good rapid-fire ability
to process information I used to call it
that's old-school now I used to say you
know you want a really big hard drive
you want to be able to have a lot of
recall a lot of information and keep it
there the second thing is you have to be
able to see the future in ways that
other people can't
and the third thing is you have to be
brave you have to be the first one off
the cliff right nobody's going to jump
unless you do and and you can't spin it
you got to believe it you know here's
here's a read example we have reached a
million customers I mean what a
milestone he's up the company meeting
he's showing the bar graph of a million
customers and afterwards he's like yeah
I want to make a rug of it and just lay
on it like and he goes he goes yes
five million like [ __ ] wait a minute
five minute we just reached a million
we've been working on that goal for four
years and he's like yeah that's that's
so yesterday five that's good number
like instantly I'm like can we have a
party goes I guess if you want but I
mean you know one is was easy now it's
five oh one more startup story engineer
call the engineer says to me penny you
don't understant management doesn't
understand it's not like it used to be
we used to all know each other and we
knew what everybody was doing and we
were all really good friends it's not
like that anymore there's too many
people when we don't get it you know a
management doesn't understand I'm like
Rob I'm a VP I report to the CEO I'm
gonna call me management and we've had
this conversation seven times so part a
of the sentence is untrue management
knows I've talked to read about it okay
second part do you know what we want to
be when we grow up no like we want to be
a global corporation and he just kind of
melts oh that's okay you don't have to
be here you're a 50-person startup guy
now by the way 50 person startups
there's three endings who are startups
bigger smaller eaten smaller is death so
I call that the smoke of nostalgia
beware in your company if you smell the
smoke of nostalgia because you don't get
to go backwards you don't get to keep it
the way it is it's an ever-evolving
thing your business if it's
successful will change so what you want
is a team of people who when things
change don't fret but go yes two
questions for you yeah one in the book
you talked about one year employees came
up to say it
I need fifty employees at fifty thousand
dollars were growing so fast I need you
to help me get this and then you said
why fifty eight fifty why not
twenty-five at 75 25 at 100 why do we
need 50 at 50 so at what point do you
know if we need 50 at 50 or 25 out of
hundred how do you process that you go
through my methodology and you decide
what the problem is you're trying to
solve and so let's say you're trying to
solve a problem of scale and you need
somebody who has a lot of experience
doing it the I think that a story I
found later I don't know if it's in the
book was when I went to a CEO who had
just gotten another round of funding and
he said yeah I really want to talk to
you cuz we're gonna scale from 150 to
300 people I said magic of 300 is that
you think if you hired twice as many
people you'll get twice as much work
done he's like yeah like yeah that's not
gonna happen
you know this is completely chaotic and
so I said are those guys in the corner
taping up boxes to ship your product he
goes yeah I'm like it's San Francisco
your pace and Francisco rents for people
to tape box what are you paying them
well we don't pay them that much I'm
like boy you don't pay them enough to
live here that's for sure
and guess what figuring out how to
efficiently tape boxes that problems
been solved so you don't need another
ten guys in the corner with tape guns
you need nobody with a cardboard box
here in San Fran in San Francisco right
so so that you could outsource right so
that is something absolutely you could
answer
are you still literally building the
product here are those guys I'm
soldering irons I'm like okay and then
how many people do you have in customer
service well yeah we're gonna need lots
more customer service people I'm like
because it doesn't work that well right
he goes yeah I'm like or a couple of
really expensive really great engineers
to help you solve the problem before
it's to the customer right and so what
we did was we walked through
first of all walked through what are the
priorities of business
what was the timeframes of those
priorities and then that same kind of
thing which is in which areas with the
highest priority do we have the weakest
teams and that's where you spend your
money right then you get the absolutely
best people conversely I worked with
another startup that had hired an HR
person they were doing compensation
she's going over her compensation plan
with me and she said yes we've decided
to pay in the 65th percentile and I said
huh why she was well that that seems
like the right thing to do and I said
okay but that's fine that fits in the
budget and all that kind of stuff in
that map matches your headcount I said
but you can't no longer say we only hire
a players okay you can't say that
anymore cuz eight players don't work for
65th percentile and I said if can I be
an employee
what is 65th percentile mean and where's
the other who gets the other 35% she was
well that's not what it means oh I know
it's not it means and you know it's when
nobody else in the world knows what it
means and did you use survey data to
come up with this yes I did I said how
hard was it to match people who ship
razor blades online like if you're gonna
if you're gonna have a compensation
system that makes sense to you a it
should make sense to you and B you
should be really transparent about it
here's how we figure out your pay and my
experience is there are often times so
the story I told you earlier about cloud
computing we extracted a really talented
team out of Yahoo in between CEOs to do
our cloud in between you guys did you
guys exploit that opportunity absolutely
so we okay so let me ask you to the part
about pure competition
what was the idea like we got a you know
extract best talent from this company
put these guys out of business was it a
sure what you said absolutely sounded
very competitive
feel that all is fair in love and war in
recruiting that's the point that's the
and I mean it both ways if you tell me
you want to be a CFO and you're actually
pretty close and I might need a CFO in a
couple of years and I'm busy working
with you on it and you're a talented guy
and I like you and I don't want you to
leave sure but somebody reaches out to
you and says I gotta see I see
CFO position in my company right now I
think you'd be amazing that well I want
you to take it right I can't I can't
have you had that conversation balute
Lee absolutely I've had more it's like
hey you were talking to so and so what
were you talking to him about I'm like
that it's time for him to go he's like
you were telling our employees to leave
happy and not into the work anymore and
he's got all these other opportunities
and every day he walks in feeling like
he passed another one by here's here's
the Google story that's in my book we
had this guy that he was a university
hire at Cisco he'd been at Cisco for
like a year and then we brought him over
to work with our most talented most
senior engineer working on the
personalization algorithms the AI and
our business and so he was sort of his
protege for about five years and the
personalization algorithms at netflix
are deep deep core software deep core
talent in part of our business right so
he's been there about five years and his
boss calls me up and says John got an
offer from Google at twice the salary
I'm like [ __ ] well tell him like not
let the door hit him in the butt on the
way he's not worth twice is he hit
Google can't pay anybody Google's got
more money good doesn't really you're
saying I'm saying that my reptilian HR
brain kicks in and I'm like no no he
doesn't look just tell him to go to
Google and they're like he can't go to
Google he's critical to us see that's
what happens when we make one person the
center of our product and it shouldn't
be like that we should be more - sir
nope so then the VP gets in then Reid
gets in we're emailing back and forth
all weekend Sunday more
I wake up and I'm like oh my god of
course they want him who else knows what
he knows I mean I'm thinking we can't
hire anybody because there's nobody that
so I sent an email at I say I was wrong
I I just looked at the salaries of
everybody on that team we can double it
and it's nothing to the PNL I can go
I'll do as soon as I get into work
they're buddies like you're supposed to
say no and who's everybody with twice so
so but what we did was we started to
have the real conversation we needed to
have which was oh my god my dream came
true
now having worked here makes you more
valuable and I started thinking about so
this is where my I'm hanging around with
inventors all the time right
so now I'm thinking wait a minute oh my
god all these companies that worry about
retention when their compensation system
is so restrictive that it makes people
and John came in he goes I heard you've
been talking about my offer at Google
I'm like yeah he says I can't say no I
got a family I mean it's not nobody it's
Google me that's pretty cool opportunity
so you know I want to stay but it's
twice my salary and you know he's like I
might be worth it and he was so he told
you I might be worth it yeah over time
what I realized was for the four people
that you want to stay that are really
critical to the business you can't keep
them that's you can't change their dose
you don't retain people it doesn't work
but you can take money off the table as
a issue right and I and I used to tell
people this also got me in trouble
with all my fellow HR people who are
they do this I said to everybody look I
know you're being recruited all the time
I know the headhunters call you I know
that we're very popular right now but
I'm trying to figure out what real
market data is for
guys and it's hard because it's shifting
so when the headhunter calls please
before you say no thanks
be sure you say how much and come tell
me so I would know what other people
were offering them and then I just went
through the company quarterly and looked
at particularly teams that we'd done a
lot of hiring on and said well so
everybody we hired makes more money than
the people we have is it there we just
hired a bunch of better people which can
be right you hired more senior people
and you pay them more or is it that the
people that you want to stay on the team
should could leave and get jobs at a
better salary right so that's just ice
you know when you start to think about
it
everything so my bigger message to you
is the way you think about your product
the way you think about your customer
the way you think about innovation you
can apply all of that to managing people
last question for we wish you the best
how did it feel when you were going
through the process of maybe you're
competing maybe you're now but you know
the company are going up against at
beginning stages of a blockbuster and
then they went out of business what was
that like for you when that took place
like what conversation that you and Reid
have about a pretty one we we used to
listen to the blockbuster earnings call
everybody in the company would go into a
conference room enlist said to the
blockbuster earnings call on the Polycom
you remember those that set in the
middle of year and we'd all sit around
the table at like listen and one of the
analysts asked John AG Tioga the CEO of
blockbuster what do you think of Netflix
and he said the stop asking me about
that stupid little company love that
they are a gnat they are no one no one
will ever use this stuff it's too hard
as he did not play that right people
loved the video stores were the largest
video retail renter in the globe Wow and
I'm looking at my CMO who's sitting
across from me and behind her on the
whiteboard is our customer growth right
and I like I told you it's like we went
oh my god he he doesn't know
right Reid had tried really gone to sell
us the year before hey you want to buy
her service he's like no I know I don't
forget whatever it was you know forty
million dollars so so then we get to the
company meeting and people are like do
it and we're like yeah so here's our
strategy like lay low
give it up Patti McCord I got a gift for
you
I gotta get free amazing I gotta get
free go let me get to give alright come
on
so I figured it just made sense to get
your old blockbuster bag and I got you
some special limited edition DVD one
week rental one week rental for okay and
then I also know you love sailing
appreciate not gonna take this with you
well you know we had to call a few
people but we got it for you so you can
go frame it and do whatever you want to
do with it make noise so Patti report
[Applause]
thank you so much

How do CEOs create an ideal work culture? 'You live it'
JOHN YANG: Finally, another installment of
our weekly Brief But Spectacular series, where
we ask people about their passions.
Tonight, we hear from Patty McCord, who, for
12 years, was chief talent officer of Netflix.
Now she coaches and advises companies and
entrepreneurs on building workplace culture
and the leadership to reinforce it, from abolishing
performance reviews to challenging the need
for policies at all.
Her latest book is called "Powerful: Building
a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility."
PATTY MCCORD, Author, "Powerful: Building
a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility":
I used to say that the only perk I wanted
to have at Netflix was showers, because you
know how everybody says, like, I had that
great idea in the shower?
So, I wanted to just have like a row of showers,
and, if we got stuck, it's like, get everybody
in the shower.
Don't come out until you get an idea.
(LAUGHTER)
PATTY MCCORD: Why do we do an annual performance
review?
Is it to give people feedback, because you
think that feedback would result in better
performance?
If that's the case, it's a really terrible
process.
So, if I went to the whiteboard, and it was
a blank slate , and I said, OK, OK, I got
this idea.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to -- once a year, we're going
to look back, and in really arbitrary, obtuse
language describe something that you may or
may not have done many months in the past,
in order for you to correct that behavior
in the future.
And, oh, by the way, we're going to call that
performance, and we're going to rate and rank
you, and we're going to roll it up with goals
and objectives.
Then we're going to put it in with our 6.5
percent merit increase budget, with a bell
curve distribution, and determine how to pay
you.
And if I did that, I mean, literally, everybody
in the room would be like, OK, there's Patty's
idea.
Anybody else?
I remember when we did the player for the
laptop.
We tested five different versions of it.
And one of the versions looked like the cockpit
of the nuclear submarine.
What the hell is that thing in the corner?
And they're like, well, Patty, that's your
buffering speed.
And I'm like, OK, here's the deal.
I'm normal.
Not only do I not care what my buffering speed
is.
I don't want to know that buffering exists.
I'm telling you, the winner is going to be
pause, forward, and reverse.
And like, so, I won that one.
Let's talk about culture fit.
Who cares?
Here's how it really works in real life in
most companies.
Hiring managers say, I need to hire somebody
who's going to be perfect.
They're going to be articulate, smart, quick
on their feet, fun to be around, and really
passionate about their work, someone, well,
just like me.
And that's who they hire, and like hires,
like hires, like hires, like -- and it's just
human nature to do that, and you got to work
against that.
People used to ask me at Netflix, like, Netflix
only hires A-players.
How do you do it?
I would say, there's an island only I know
about and all the A-players are there, and
I'm not telling you where it is.
It's the problem that you have to solve and
the person who's incredibly passionate about
doing it and capable of doing it.
My startup CEOs, they're so adorable.
They're like, how do I hire somebody like
you to take care of the culture for me?
And I'm like, well, you don't.
It's your job forever, or get another one,
don't be CEO.
Like, you own this.
Well, OK, I get it.
I will take ownership for it.
So how do I do it?
I'm like, you live it.
Live it.
If you want to be efficient, then show up
on time.
If you want to have honest discourse with
people, then be honest with people.
Teach people how to learn from their mistakes.
Teach people how to make the right decisions.
Teach people how to be bold.
And how you teach them how to do it is, you
do it, so they can see it.
I'm Patty McCord, and this is my Brief But
Spectacular take on rethinking work.

Patty McCord: Building a Culture of Freedom & Responsibility, WINNOVATE 2018 Keynote
[Music]
thanks for having me today I'm not going
to talk about data we're not going to do
anything digital and I don't have a
video so if you want to be disappointed
just start off that way I just wrote a
book and it's called powerful and I
named it that because of a couple of
things and when I talk today you're
gonna hear me talk a little smut about
my own organization about my own
function because I don't think that HR
people do things as well as they could
do and I think that's partly because you
as leaders don't expect very much from
them so one of the things that I hate
most about HR speak and management speak
is that it's not the language that the
rest of the world uses I mean how can we
have to have our own words right and one
of my least favorite words is
empowerment you're empowered like what
we have a magic wand we go around
empowering people you know why we have
to empower people these days because we
took it all away from them there's all
the rules and all the process and all
the things that we do because we've
always done them we do things in
management the way we've always done it
and then we call it best practices like
you know when you guys say best
practices you actually measure it right
so what I want to challenge us to do
today is to think about the things that
we do that we've always done because
that's the way we've always done them
and all of you the people that I heard
this morning talking about transforming
your organizations and your teams and
leading into the future and being ready
for those digital global quick moving
fast innovative organizations we can't
keep doing it the way we always did it
because we're just going to end up with
the same thing right ok I get to speak
to groups like you a lot and when I am
on stage a lot I am now paired with
coaches with professional sports coaches
and so one of the things
that we did when I was at Netflix was we
stopped using the word family right how
many of you are how many of you are in
the same job that you had when you left
high school or college wow there's two
people are you interns the rest of us
did not because we move on and yet we
obsess all the time with retention and
keeping people and turnover right when
the truth is that we all move on and the
truth is that when we join a company we
don't join a family you don't gonna
you're not gonna lay off your
brother-in-law because he borrows money
and doesn't pay it back right that's a
family that's a different situation than
when you're a team and when you're a
team you can start thinking about things
really differently here's one of the
basic things that I did differently at
Netflix that I invite you to do what I
decided I wanted to do that point at
that company for me was to create the
kind of company that would be a great
place to be from imagine that imagine if
that's the kind of teams that you build
teams that are great places to be from
right so that whatever you give people
that's the skill that's the information
that's the value that they bring to
their next employer for the rest of
their lives okay so this is a picture of
Montreal Canada I got invited to speak
there in February anybody been to
Montreal in February okay well I hadn't
I'm from California right so I tell my
daughter I'm gonna go speak in Montreal
in February she goes mom go to Patagonia
get a puffy coat get it now right one of
the long ones you basically want to wear
a sleeping bag so then I start looking
at the weather in Canada and I realize
that it's 18 below zero so I get a hotel
so that I can go underground and I can
go to the place where I'm gonna speak at
the last minute I'm going to speak with
a guy named Scott Bowman anybody know
who Scott Bowman is he's a former
National Hockey League coach one of the
winningest coaches in hockey history I'm
also speaking at the Bell Centre in
Montreal does anybody know what happens
there
the Stanley Cup right so I'm down below
in the green room it's kind of like this
one back here but it's below the place
where I'm gonna talk and I'm with Scott
Bowman and he's this lovely seventy year
old man and we're talking about his kids
and his grandkids and where he likes to
play golf and he looks at me and he goes
you know what Patti we're under the ice
and it occurs to me that we're in a
hockey stadium I've never spoken to a
room bigger than this and all of a
sudden I'm in a hockey stadium so I walk
up the back stairs and I come out of
stage like this and there's there's a
Jumbotron
and my face is on it's like oh it's
really scary to see your face that big
anywhere right so the crowd which is
thousands of people they introduced me
and everybody politely claps and I sit
down and my little chair and I'm I've
got my Botox face on you know the one
where you're listening to your do you
don't know what you're supposed to be
doing but you do it anyway
Scott Bowman comes up on stage blocks up
onto the stage the crowd goes ballistic
right this is the winningest coach in
hockey league history in the hockey
stadium oh my god I mean people are like
clapping like this you know if they had
those foam fingers they'd be foam
fingering they're taking selfies with
him so he comes up on stage and he sits
next to me and the moderator says mr.
Bowman you've won so many games so many
tournaments you've coached all the
greats what's your secret to success and
he said well we play an 80 game season
and every 10 games I sit down with each
of my players and they do a
self-evaluation I do an evaluation I
look at all the stats I look at of the
teams that we're going to play for the
next ten games how we're going to be a
better team how we're going to work
together what that person should do to
improve what we're going to do to
improve as a team who were going to play
against and I do that with every member
every ten games for the entire eighty
game season moderator says to me Patti
McCord
it's said that you hate the annual
performance review and I do
I think it's an utter complete waste of
time but he said but I never heard
say what you would do differently and I
said what he said right so if you think
about coaching your teams to higher
performance
I recommend that one of the places that
you look right away is to see what other
great coaches are doing with their teams
a couple of weeks ago I was in Austin
Texas in the head of the the coach for
the San Antonio Spurs was on stage and
somebody said and the artist is very
sensitive audience oh you know you must
feel so terrible when you recruit all
those incredible players at the end of
the season you have to let them go does
that hurt and he says no it's basketball
right I mean they sign up for it they
know they're not going to be dribbling
in center court when they're 55 years
old right so one of the things I want to
invite you to do is to think about the
teams that you are in charge of the
teams within your organization and how
you want to manage them to optimal
performance because it's my firm belief
after 30 years of doing what I'm doing
that when you go home and you from work
and you tell your spouse or your pet oh
my god it was a great day at work , it's
usually not , the food was amazing it
was we did it and if you ask people
about a time at work that was amazing
that they're proud of if you think about
it yourself close your eyes and say well
I was really proud of of accomplishing
that it's almost always hard so here in
Silicon Valley here in the Bay Area I
consult with a lot of startups I've seen
swings and hammocks at the same place
most of the places that I go to have
full bars you know and we wonder why
people are still unhappy when we're
doing so much work to make them happy
and I think what makes people happy is
winning and I think what makes people
happy is doing amazing things with other
people but it's kind of about who's on
the team isn't it so at Netflix one day
Reid said to the head of product and I
hey guess who called me this morning who
read you so we don't know all the
important people call you now well Steve
Jobs had call
and Steve Jobs had wanted Netflix to be
on a new device that he was building
which we were too referred to as the
transformational device
it was the iPad of course but we didn't
know that it didn't have a name it was
only the transformational device and
seriously only seven people from the
company were allowed into the specials
area at Apple where the transformational
device was held okay so we launched it
it's a big success it's amazing you know
if you think about it I think touch
technology is probably one of the most
transformative technologies that's come
along in my lifetime so I walk into the
product meeting and everybody's sitting
around bunch of geeks like you guys and
and I say like I do oh my god it is
transformational touch is like it's like
mammalian it's primal right and you
laugh I was at dinner and a two-year-old
was streaming Spongebob in his highchair
next to me you can't even read I mean
isn't it I can't wait until I walk into
my media room and I swipe the wall and
movie starts playing and the guys they
started like riffing like jazz musicians
you know and one of them goes oh man we
won't make you get up you still say on
the couch and somebody else says yeah
take out your phone it's gonna have a
mood ohmmeter and you put your thumb on
it it'll say Oh patty are you sad and
instantly a romantic comedy starring all
my favorite actress will start playing
and I thought you know what they're
gonna make that happen someday I'm gonna
be in the room full of people that are
going to be able to make that happen and
that's what you know each of you know is
the the secret to making amazing
companies it's having amazing teams so I
have a little methodology that I want to
teach you about it because I think it'll
help you create the kind of teams that
you want there are teams that look a
little bit different than everybody in
the room so if you think about what your
team needs to accomplish in six months
to a year I want you to think about what
you need to accomplish and what will be
occurring differently than is occurring
now so give me all your numerals you got
all your metric
there's gonna be you know we're gonna
accomplish this by this it's gonna be
faster it's gonna be more complex it's
got whatever it's gonna be and then make
a movie of it are people talking to each
other more are there more meetings are
there less meetings is there somebody
who gets up and asks if somebody else in
marketing why they did that dumb thing
or they're just sitting around
complaining about it right what's really
occurring then you drop down and say
okay in order for that stuff to happen
in order for that to occur in that
timeframe six months to a year what do
people need to know how to do right do
you need people who are more curious do
you need people who are more aggressive
do you need people who have seen scale
or complexity okay now we know that then
you drop down and say what kind of
skills and experience would it take for
someone to know how to do that in order
to accomplish that in that timeframe and
then and only then who do you have
because if you start with the team that
you have you can only do as much as that
team can do and if you start with the
optimal team that you want and you start
with the problem that you're trying to
solve then you're gonna go about hiring
the people that can solve that problem
and are passionate about it not just
other people who are just like you and
just like the other people on the team I
just did a video the other day and I
said okay here's the truth about how
people really get promoted you guys know
this right you're in a room and someone
says you know I need somebody really
bright a name to be really smart
effective intuitive Authority someone
just like me
maybe me 10 years ago because you don't
want them to be too threatening right
and that's what you hire and that's how
we end up with these homogeneous
organizations where everybody's the same
because everybody assumes that all the
smart people look like the smart person
that started the deep so what I invite
you to do rather than do that is start
with the problem that you're trying to
solve work your way backwards fill in
those gaps in Delta's and oh by the way
if it turns out in that analysis that
there are people on the team that you
wouldn't hire
if they walked in the door to be on that
team today you can tell them so the
other part of what I want you to think
about is that radical honesty the
ability to tell people the truth about
what's going on with them is efficient
it's effective and it's kinder than
keeping the truth from them
here's another thought another thing I
hate I hate performance improvement
plants I always say RI P the P I P you
know remember the story I just told you
about Scott Bowman he actually was
proposing a performance improvement plan
you know what a good tool that would be
too bad we can't actually use it anymore
because it secretly means we're trying
to get rid of you so in my scenario
where I'm working backwards and I
realize oh wow for what I have to do I
actually don't have the right team right
it's not that these people aren't great
they're amazing they're just the wrong
people to do that job so I'm gonna put
them on a performance improvement plan
their issues not performance so think
about things like that right why did we
do crazy stuff like that it's so cruel
I'm gonna put I'm gonna prove to you in
writing over a three month period that
you're incompetent when we both know
that's not true
I think you can have conversations with
people that say hey by the way here's
what the team looks like here's what we
need to accomplish here's the skills we
need to have here's what people need to
know how to do and you don't do it and
you don't like it and it's okay so where
else do we find so that you're able to
make the contribution that you can make
in the world and own your own career so
this is my algorithm for success because
I work with guys like you my whole life
and I if I say words like algorithm it
helps and as you all know it's a
mathematical sentence that's true and
this is my mathematical sentence about
people is what you love to do that
you're extraordinarily good at doing
something we need someone to be great at
so it's a very simple formula to look at
the people on your team if they
I'm happy then it's probably because
you're having them do something either
they're not great at or they don't love
it's honestly that simple and when you
try and squeeze those things together it
rarely works because now the person is
going to try and prove that you could
really use that secret talent that they
have that's a lot undiscovered
that really if you discovered it you
wouldn't care because you don't need to
right so and for yourself make sure that
you're doing the things you love to do
that you're extraordinarily good at
doing as leaders because then people can
see that magic happen and they can see
that that's where real power comes from
is people who are really capable at
doing stuff that's really important and
necessary so you know when I coach
women's groups or people earlier in
their career I tell them this is a
really important key thing to learn as
you go out into the workforce every day
and and recognize that I was just
talking to Bianca earlier about
sometimes I say you know those employee
engagement stories you guys do those who
does employment engagement surveys I
tell women especially like so when your
company talks about engagement nobody
put a ring on it and when you go
interview with somebody else you're not
cheating on your husband you're actually
trying to find out what you're worth and
I recommend that people do that all the
time and if you're in a very large
organization which many of you are like
here's another thing that's weird how
come when what somebody from your
department gets called by somebody from
another department to interview for the
their department that's poaching but
when we go get great people from other
companies to work for us that's staffing
and strangers can call our employees and
recruit them and that's okay but we
can't call each other and recruit each
other so the other thing is these
amazing in future leaders of your
companies are already in your companies
and it's perfectly reasonable to be
thinking about recruiting as something
that you do inside as well as you do it
outside because those of you who have
been around as leaders for a long time
you know who rises to the top the people
that get stuff done right you see it you
can see it because you've flowed over it
so when you float over it be sure that
you look for every kind of face when
you're looking for somebody to be
successful because transformation how we
move our organizations into the world of
the future is not about understanding
and recognizing that Millennials are
different than us okay you are a
millennial I was a millennial it's
called being in your 20s what do you
want near 20s everything when do you
want it now right okay so my son just
turned 30 I said so what do I call you a
third lineal now right well he just got
a different job and he got engaged and I
bet y'all get a grandkid pretty soon
guess what he won't be a millennial
anymore
guess what he won't be twenty and single
anymore so if you think about the people
in our organizations as people at
different parts of their career rather
than stereotyping them let's let's think
about Millennials and maturity right I
know a lot of very mature 20-somethings
I know a lot of really immature 40
year-olds am i right okay so when we
start pairing the people with the future
and the abilities and different
perspectives with those of us who have
been around a while and have some wisdom
and we can put those two things together
in a way that we're learning from each
other then we're transforming our
organizations into organizations that
are that can move quicker that can think
faster and they can leverage each
other's knowledge and that's what I
think is the real transformation
understanding that Millennials use their
cell phones all the time because so do
we write the other part about
transformation that's really important
for you guys to do is to understand that
people can't be what they can't see and
the most important thing you can do with
your organization to change your culture
is to look at you and your team and make
sure that you and your team are walking
the talk every single day because my
experience with engineers in particular
and I love you guys the world is good or
bad black or white
right or wrong zero or one am i right
and everything in between this
and any time you say something and you
do something different then the cynical
conspiracy theorist rises up and so
don't give them a reason to do that be
who you want to be tell your truth think
about everything that you do in your
organization that you could be doing
differently think about every management
process and procedure and treat it like
a product okay so back to the Scotty
Baumann story let's say we believed that
giving people feedback was important for
their performance kind of everybody
agrees with that so let's say we want to
put together a system so that we can
give people feedback to improve their
performance if you would if that was the
product you were building would you
build the annual performance review I
mean giving people feedback once a year
is not going to improve their
performance and then people say oh well
giving feedback is really hard they
always mean here's here's an interesting
thing about feedback in this culture
around the world these days
it means feedback equals constructive
criticism which means telling people
something hard that they don't want to
hear in a way that doesn't seem mean
right if you really those of us who
have pets and children you know which
kind of feedback works that what you
just did that's great do that again when
you give people that feedback they do it
that afternoon instead we do that that
was a bad thing you did that bad thing
again when you do that bad thing again
feel bad and we do but it's really
ineffective right so think about the
thing every single thing that you're
doing as a management practice in your
company and ask yourself two things why
and if I started over again is this what
I would do and more importantly here's a
crazy crazy crazy innovative idea oh my
god this is incredible stop doing stuff
that doesn't matter you want free time
to innovate you want some space in your
organization to do things differently
you want speed then make sure that the
things that are in front of the people
that work for you aren't getting in
their way right do you really need to
ask permission from somebody and finance
to spend over ten thousand dollars or
whatever your limit is because your
engineers know that ten thousand fifty
is more than ten thousand trust me right
so every time that you integrate and you
cross functionally collaborate and you
put people in teams that can understand
each other's perspectives particularly
those of you in security
it's you've got to be able to speak each
other's language and talk to each other
because that's how we transform
companies into teams that move faster so
to innovate sometimes it means stop and
whinnies and when you start start with
something old that you've always done
and imagine that if you started from
scratch how you might do it differently
do you guys want to talk do you have any
questions you want to talk about things
that are in your organization that we
could fix or what's what's in be
standing between you and real
transformation no I've stunned you
you know it I learned all this stuff at
Netflix because we reinvented our
business more than once and though the
story of Netflix is a story of
incredible success and and forward
moving innovation but the truth is it
wasn't always that way and we had lots
and lots of obstacles how many have you
used the dvd-by-mail service some of you
in the US yeah remember when we started
that blockbuster was a hundred and fifty
times bigger than we were right and
those of you that use the streaming
service all around the world when we
launched the streaming service on the
laptop right which was the only way that
we could do it we never imagined that
you'd be able to take content and watch
it in five different countries in five
different days because all the content
was purchased by each region right so
the global the global company that
Netflix is these days the global self
producing content company bears no
resemblance to the company I started
that was putting DVD in the mail and
that's because we paid tons of attention
to articulating where we were going what
the timeframe was and we wrote down how
we wanted to behave with each other as
we did it so culture is something that's
always evolving you can't keep it
culture can't be transformed by one
person demanding that it be so cultures
behaviors its rituals it's the stories
you tell it's what you reward it's what
you punish if the it's the things that
people see each other doing it's not
what you say you're going to do so that
real transformation can only come from
you and from the people on your teams
talk to me someone
or I'll have to start singing and
dancing I'll have to start ranting about
equal pay I can so if I don't ask a
question you'll sing and dance I might
do it anyway
asking a question the right when you
talk about a lot of the things you're
talking about it makes sense with teams
that are winning teams that are in good
situations teams with good trajectories
can you share a couple of tips hints
tricks of how organizations that are
going through turmoil organizations that
are in turnaround mode organizations
where the people on the team feel like
they're on the oh and twelve team just
trying to get a little bit of win like
how you manage in those situations where
a lot of these concepts which I
subscribe to they just it doesn't seem
like they fit on day one I mean how you
ultimately get a team to you know to the
point where you can put some of these
more innovative things in place yeah
well you've got to be really clear about
where they're going or where they're not
and in the situation you're describing
to me are these the right people going
forward or they just stuck because
because if you have a team of people
that really is the wrong team to do what
you need to do then set them free right
set them free so they can find great
work somewhere else but are you just
talking about something that's tedious
and hard no I'm talking about a good
team that's just been put into a bad
situation yeah well then I think if it
very much is about vision and outcome
you know I had a great guy that I
learned a ton from and I can't use the
the the slang word that I usually use
but he's my own Messer upper you know
it's I had to explain to my CFO one time
we were sitting in the engineering
meetings and the engineers were talking
about hair balls in the code and he said
Patti
but they said hair ball like what does
that mean I said oh that's a technical
term because for what I'm like oh when
you know the technology just gets so
convoluted and nobody remembers who
started it there's nothing left to do
but either untangle it or cough it up
which is how I learned about culture too
by the way hairball and culture
but that's a situation that you just
have to untangle the hairball right you
have to take it and stretch it out and
the other thing I think about teams that
are in situations like that make sure
that you celebrate every win even if
it's small right those are the hard
pushing the rock uphill things are tough
to do but we sometimes don't reward
people until the rock is all the way up
the hill instead of resting you know
giving people some encouragement and
then moving it forward those are tough
situations yeah okay yeah the question
is how do I describe leadership in the
truths it's when leaders stand up and
say the hard things it's when leaders
teach people how to lead so here's an
example I always say you know when I
when you confront an employee so first
of all hire really smart people give
them really wonderful things to do and
expect a lot from them that's the three
of them and on expectations you know if
you expect excellence you'll be
surprised what you get even from
mediocre people if you expect me to
yakity that's all you'll ever get but
when someone says or you hear that noise
in the organization you know management
doesn't know what they're doing they
made a bad decision or you stand up and
you're going to admit that you made a
bad decision there's two things you need
to do when the person says management
doesn't know what they're doing
one if you're in management what would
you do to more importantly second
question if you're in management what
information would you need to have to
make a great decision so the more you
can model that questioning that we do as
executives that we seem at every single
level what would you do what information
would you need to have we can teach
people how to think critically and so
we've read
first it now and we call it empowerment
right we're going to empower you to
think critically well you have to have
contacts you have to have information
you have to have guidance about making
decisions so I think we're when I see
leadership it's when leadership stands
up and says hey by the way that
direction that we were going I was wrong
right here's the information I had when
I made that decision at the time here's
the information that I have now that's
really important and that sets the
context for you to be able to make a
decisions so pushing context down allows
more people to stand up and take
leadership positions they need to know
why you know I always say like when I'm
talking to you and I think this guy does
not have a clue he doesn't know what the
hell he's talking about
if I assume that you're a smart person
like me then I'm gonna have to close my
eyes and count to 10 and say he doesn't
know what the hell he's talking about
you simply don't know right so I now
need to give you better information
better context for you to make decisions
and so that we can have a conversation
about the problem we're trying to solve
the other thing I think that's really
important is to behave and talk about
what we're doing on behalf of the
customer so sometimes we take that
management means being really kind to
people and taking an interest in them
personally but management means really
telling everybody who you work for and
that person that you work for doesn't
usually live in the company so the more
we can pay attention to our customers
and our clients and our constituents
then we're more able to serve each other
as members of the team right so we don't
have to make each other happy we just
have to make that person happy that
doesn't work here anymore some ideas
yeah
so Perry thank you for sharing some of
your insights very very I think a
different perspective you put a lot of
focus on the culture and the culture of
it I'd like to get your thoughts when
you're hiring somebody from outside is
the culture fit is important or the
culture augmentation is important I
think it's important that you think
about what you're talking about when you
say culture so I'm very anthropological
about it right I think it's the way you
operate it's more like you're operating
style and principles and fundamentals
than it is about the way you act so like
when I talk to young companies they
think culture means a culture fit means
I want to have a beer with them right
and there's plenty of people that I want
to have a beer with that I do not want
to work with and there's plenty of
people that I work with that I wouldn't
necessarily want to have a beer with but
I love being shoulder-to-shoulder with
them so if you think about again the
focus on the problem that you're trying
to solve rather than the person then
you're gonna be more open to lots of
different ways to go about that to think
about that so it's not you know and the
other thing is culture is not this big
overarching global thing the way you
operate fundamentally as people is like
if you say that you want to be honest
and truthful right you want to have
people with integrity who operate
independently and truthfully but the
truth is no one ever actually does and
some people have all the information and
other people don't then people see right
through that right so so cultures about
what you do so that's what you have to
think about so so for example when I
would interview people for fit at
Netflix we were very very very very
deliverable driven right we really
wanted people who we believed would
accomplish what they needed to
accomplish on time with quality to meet
the customers needs and if
they didn't and they weren't able to
they'd raise their hands and say they
couldn't right and so one of the big
culture fit misses for us often was
people who were in large organizations
where people did a lot of presentations
and didn't actually accomplish anything
so we were very hands-on so that that's
an example of a culture fit thing that's
not in the esoteric honesty and
integrity right it's about really being
able to deliver stuff on time you know I
think about God asked a lot when Google
just had its big brouhaha about the
James stand where the guy that wrote the
treatise inside of Google and people ask
me you know would you have fired him and
I'm like of course but hopefully I
wouldn't have hired him in the first
place you know that guy was arrogant in
the interview I mean you know don't
don't hire people who have attitude and
you probably won't have people have
attitude in your company pay attention
to that stuff right I never said I told
you so
and I also never said no I would
interview somebody at the end I would
say hey did he tell you about his
current boss hogg I was such a jerk
you tell you about the last boss he was
even worse I can't believe the bad luck
this guy's had like yeah how far about
you go because I went to high school do
you know who's smarter than his high
school principal do you know that he's
been smarter than every CEO he's ever
worked for it do you know he smarter
than pretty much everybody on the planet
and he's a miserable unhappy guy yeah my
mama would say misery loves company so
guess what's gonna happen to your happy
team oh I can handle am I gonna handle
it
sure you can right but everybody else is
gonna be miserable but you tell me I
can't hire this guy one no it's not my
team the job of be of management is to
build great teams it's really that great
teams that do amazing work that serve
the customer on time with quality and
that's it and so that's where you know
when you have that team that has to
struggle your job is to make sure that
anything that gets in their way
that those distractions come apart
because I just
come away from them because I just makes
them crazy and make the slows it down
all right let's talk a couple of things
since I have my bully pulpit here
let's fix pay inequality you guys spend
a lot of money you write a lot of checks
I'm not talking big data here in the
cloud you know give it get the average
salaries of every male and female person
by job title in your organization if
there's a discrepancy fix it go a long
long way and don't do things that HR is
going to police you to do better I was
just an HR convention thing and I said
to them I'm like look it's not our job
to punish people for sexual harassment
after it happens it's our job to make
sure this doesn't happen in our
organizations and it's your job to and
these these transformations these global
transformations are really important for
us we need all the capable you know this
we need every capable creative talent
and technical worker that we can find so
make sure that everybody who has that
capability is being paid the same amount
of attention to so that you guys have
the workforce that you need for the
future because it really matters yeah hi
I'm Mia Gomes I'm from Thomas Jefferson
University and Jefferson Health System
ha ha what I'd really be interested in
is you know as a digital company Netflix
that created a digital platform that we
all enjoy
I'm the chief digital officer Jefferson
so this is a natural question for me how
did you use digital platforms at Netflix
in the HR space you know we have
challenges in almost every other space
in most industries HR has seen as a
blocker many times for doing innovative
kinds of things they want to standardize
let's say you know job descriptions or
they want to standardize competencies
and they try to push you into a box that
maybe you don't fit into you know
and you know but with digital platforms
machine learning AI the kinds of things
that sold Netflix as a business and made
it valuable to consumers how do you take
that and then apply it to a field like a
charm well I never did any of those
things I never did I never preached
sameness I never tried to put people in
the box I didn't I think in our
engineering team for almost 15 years I
had one job title software engineer and
the salary range was like 70 K to 700 AD
because it was it was it mattered what
you did and what your skills were what
your market value was I think there's a
ton of space for innovation with digital
platforms in HR but I don't think any of
its around the stuff that we
traditionally do just making something
automated or putting it online you know
like I talked to HR people who get just
like all excited because they put their
form online and it you know it's like
really seriously I can buy a car with my
cell phone but I can't get permission to
spend money you know it give you an
example like all the approvals all the
stuff that we do for approval process is
almost everything you know so so we've
also done these big pendulum swings
right HR used to be an administrative
function and the truth is we can
automate virtually all of the
administrative functions so that's a
really good useful help of getting stuff
done in our companies that humans don't
need to do anymore and so HR people
didn't like doing that stuff either
by the way then we swung to HR s the
department that keeps you from getting
sued by your employees watch out for
those evil employees because they might
sue you so you know sometime I want you
guys to walk yourselves through what it
would actually take to sue a company you
know why people sue companies because
they're pissed that's why they that's
why they sue and then and they have to
stay mad for a really long time so if
you if you wanted to really sue a
company in America in particular I think
from like filing a complaint with the
EEOC
see to being in a courtroom is on
average six years
you can stay mad for a long time so the
truth is protecting ourselves from the
2% of people who are gonna do that evil
thing I mean you guys know this your
security folks right so you want to make
sure that you you get to the you get to
the whatever the problem is and
eliminate the problem rather than then
close down the whole system because
there might be a problem sometimes so
that's the way we've swung the pendulum
and H aren't silly so you know I think
there's lots of ways to do feedback
digitally I think that the way we work
remotely is super helpful I think I have
every face-to-face digital communication
platform known to humankind on my laptop
you know people like hey can we do a
video interview I'm like are we zooming
are we skyping which which platform are
we using now so I think all of that
stuff is super helpful but I don't think
I don't think automating a process that
we don't even need is very helpful so
there's this less of a buck who's the
head of HR at Google he has an HR
analytics team he's not there anymore
but when he was there he spent five
years at Google analyzing every single
promotion every single highly rated
manager every single attribute that made
great management at Google for five
years he went through all the
performance reviews he went through all
the referrals I mean incredible
analytics what he came up with is
astounding great managers communicate
clearly and often you know our absolute
have have goals and objectives that are
hard but can be met they praise people
when they get smites I know it's it's
amazing how he came up with that but he
couldn't he couldn't say those things to
engineers at Google's without data so I
think it's about I think the best thing
that you can do with if with your HR
teams is tell them how to productize
what they do tell them how to be
evaluative ask them why do we do this
and if it's because somebody might sue
you then you could ask or it's against
the law you can say can I see the
statute laws are written so
that you can read them and it's usually
not against the law it's usually that
somebody might sue so then you can say
when's the last time somebody got sued
for that what were the damages right so
let's we can push back on each other
because we do with products why can't we
do it with how we run people right how
we manage people so it's just teasing
about teaching people how to run it like
a product thank you for having me here
it's been really wonderful and I want
you to go out and throw something away
promise okay thank you

Patty McCord: A Culture of Innovation
so our next speaker is Patty McCord
she's got over 20 years of experience in
human resources throughout Silicon
Valley high tech companies among others
she's worked with Sun and pure atria and
currently is the chief of talent at the
extraordinary Netflix she'll be speaking
about Netflix a culture of innovation
without further ado patty McCourt I'm
I'm not gonna I don't know how to talk
to you like all these other guys are
really cool at talking to you you know
like they know a whole bunch of stuff I
have a bunch of stuff I still don't know
we're in the middle of inventing our
culture and so what I'm going to do is
just kind of as a storyteller tell you
the story of Netflix from how we started
to how we got to today in terms of
culture Reid called me at two o'clock in
the morning and said are you sleeping
and I said yes key I'm normal he said
I'm gonna go run Netflix Netflix have
about 30 people Rita told me about the
idea like you put movies in the mail and
mail them to people and I said uh-huh
and he said I'm gonna go run Netflix and
be CEO he was chairman of the board and
I said okay that's a nice career move
why are you telling me this in the
middle of the night and he said I want
you to come too and I said no nope nope
call somebody else who doesn't know what
you're talking about I've already done a
start-up with you an oh by the way the
DVD and the Mail idea is just kind of
weird okay work with me on it
why on God's earth would I do this read
and he said let's make the company we
always dreamed of right what if we wrote
down all the mistakes we made and we
promised each other we wouldn't make
them again it would be a company that it
would be a great place to be from that
if you had Netflix on your resume it
mattered now remember we had 30 people
we had due dates and late fees the
website barely worked the whole service
sucked okay first thing we wrote down
were the value so these are the seven
aspects of our culture and I'm going to
run through the
quick I'm not going to go through all
these slides you can read them online on
our website under the jobs page our
strategies there too and what we did the
values thing we wrote down that was the
first thing we wrote down and we did
that consciously at 30 people and what I
wanted to do was not write it so I'm I'm
kind I'm a lousy HR person you guys I
really am not good at any of this stuff
so I'm I couldn't think of the esoteric
values what I did know was I wanted to
write down this stuff who gets promoted
who gets let go what are the behaviors
so we wrote our values down as behaviors
and and I'll say this a million times
this one in the upper left hand corner
trumps everything
common sense and judgment Trump's
everything that's what you want to look
for in everybody that you hire are they
snot or only are they smarter do they
make good calls they have good judgment
so we pull the IPO we go into 2001
September 11th happens
anthrax happens everything goes through
the mail right I'm down at the Pope you
know San Jose Police Department set my
shipping center all the time like see
like if the guy did it in a Netflix
envelope we know his address it's a good
thing see in October of 2001 I laid off
a third of the company
we're 120 people and we said okay here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna rent
DVDs right we're gonna get them online
better than anybody else on the planet
that's it
tomorrow when you come to work it
doesn't make the customer happy if it
doesn't save us money or move the
business forward don't any questions on
the vision because it's all we had it's
all we could afford right we were broke
I laid myself off I said Reed we got to
taking an exec out he gets you know who
he gonna take out I'm like me I wrote
myself a severance letter and made him
sign it and so all the you guys that
talk about letting people go I made him
sign and I handed it to him and as he's
signing his name I start crying
I don't cry right he's like well you're
in what the hell you know you wrote the
letter you're
can you sign it and you're weeping I'm
like what if it's successful I'm not
here so he says he he amends the seventh
letter and says work part-time and if we
can make payroll in January you'll stay
and so what happened that Christmas was
DVD players dropped to $99 and inside
every DVD player box was a coupon that
said tried Netflix for free all those
people were at home out of work watched
movies because it either cheers you up
or makes you more depressed and our
business took off
I mean took off okay so I open an office
in LA we're moving our office to Beverly
Hills kind of cool huh is about this big
and I go down and the reception I sent
the receptionist down there to help do
some facility stuff and I like to walk
in the morning especially around Beverly
Hills because it's pretty damn cool so I
show up the office and I say yeah you
know it's a really long way from
Wilshire Boulevard and I took the wrong
turn and you know I got lost but you
know there's all these cool things and
she goes oh yeah why are you stay on
Wilshire Boulevard there's a hotel right
around the corner you just walk from
there and I'm like well what hotel she
goes laramie Taj like just even heard me
Taj Jessie yeah she goes I got a
corporate rate like what it was it she's
six forty nine a nine
she usually 8:50 and Patti the room
service are you kidding me now the
beautiful thing was I'd gotten a lot of
pressure from the CFO to have a travel
policy right and what I learned from
this experience with her was no I now
know that I will she will leave the
company right but not because she
violated the travel policy but because
she didn't treat it like her own company
right it was full at the time really
literally you know I was buying IKEA
furniture and she's staying at Laramie
Taj you know that's like an entire desk
the one night we used to do people from
South of Market would come over and go
you know at my dot-com startup we all
have air on chairs
I'd be like you know this suckers cut
$800 you how many DVDs we could buy for
an Aeron chair
everything was times 20/20 because
that's what DVD class this addresses
that problem of scale right which is
like if we get bigger are we going to
automatically become bureaucratic is it
inevitable all companies hit these walls
and and you think that these are your
choices well we either got to stay small
or we got to avoid rules and then we'll
you will put process in and that'll be
better but we decided to try an even
different option the fourth option more
high instead of having more rules just
hire better people who have better
judgment so you can have fewer rules and
if you haven't gotten the theme already
that's because I'm not really an HR
person and I stopped being one when I
came to Netflix I became an entrepreneur
and inventor just like everybody else
who worked there so I got to go and say
well how come we have to have rules at
this point what what is it about it what
if I just had smarter people and if you
keep having smarter people and the
business gets more complex this has
turned out to be unbelievably true true
for us I do a lot of HR people very very
very few of them talk or think like you
do when you go to conferences I'm sure
you've been invited HR tech IRM sure
yeah I only go once then they don't ever
ask me seriously like like they just ah
paddy
how does HR get a seat at the table see
at the table hmm you earned it you
matter right you know how do you get
executive buy-in what executives don't
buy-in executives run companies so how
you hire great HR people is you hire
great business people who care about
your business and don't give a
about HR love it
if somebody isn't performing technically
then you made a bad hire
then the performance issue is the hiring
manager not the employee okay so that's
the thing one thing too is it's almost
always about scale change in technology
or shift in business almost always
occasionally it's the the culture
mismatch I'm terminating an engineer who
I hired from eBay he's a big Russian guy
we're in the exit interview and he's
like I am so angry Petty I'm so angry
I'm like great I get the angry Russian
got the bear right and I'm in a
conference room and I'm like well who
you mad at
and he goes I am mad it's me Mike well
what did we do Vladimir he says well you
know I you kept giving me feedback that
I wasn't a very good communicator and
he's like I'm a great communicator I
tell jokes I have beers with the guys I
get along they all love me then off at
my jokes I'm like aha and he goes but
you know at eBay I had like this group
of underlings who had come in in Monday
morning and they would give me my
schedule and they would compile code
every night and refresh all my reports
and you know put everything together and
then on Friday they work on although we
can to give you a next schedule all I
had to do is walk in sit down and write
code I'm like oh yeah you guys and here
you expect me to tell everybody around
me what I'm doing I'm supposed to send
out emails and tell my fellow workers
what I'm doing I'm like yeah problem huh
well if you had to do over again what
would you do and he said I wouldn't come
I wouldn't come he's like you know I
kind of like being an important guy in
having little people help me and I said
what you gonna do and he goes don't go
back you know it was wonderful
conversation early on I hired an IBM
guys like you people are never going to
grow up it's completely insane around
here
you're never gonna act like a real
company I'm like we want to say that
again just a little calmly you're never
going to grow up we're never going to
back
a real company we're never gonna be IBM
he I said you know we made a mistake
both of us
so I mean I I call myself the queen of
the good goodbye I mean lots and lots of
Exim plays I hear from all the time and
they're really good friends and you know
I want everybody all the amazing people
that we hire to be really successful
it's just not always going to be with us
forever I don't feel bad about that I
feel great about that
if you cocktail time thank you

Experiment with The Way Your People Work with Patty McCord
[Music]
you are very unconventional with the way
you look at hr
and i know a lot of people were even
would even say
hmm and question the way that you do
things but
you did it and you pushed through and
you showed how it was successful from
the success of netflix
did you know this intuitively or is this
something you
learned somehow how did you know you
know i
i didn't there's a couple of reasons for
who i am
part is that i got into hr through
recruiting
and that's a really different way to
think about things because when you're a
recruiter and somebody leaves the
company you're pretty happy about it
that gives you
another you know seat to fill and so you
learn about
matchmaking uh people and their
skills and their talents and their
desires with problems that the company
has to solve
so that's a really basic thing the
second thing is by the time i reached
the
you know head of hr at a company i was
very very traditional and in fact
reading reid hastings the ceo of netflix
and i worked together at a company
before netflix
where we were very traditional and it
was just boring
so how he convinced me to come to
netflix was to say
what if we tried to create this company
that was really successful and we still
wanted to work there
so that was the catnip right i mean
that's what drew me in was
could we experiment with the way we
worked
not just the work that we did

Patty McCord - Powerful - Bregman Leadership Podcast
we have with us today Patti McCord she
is the author of powerful building a
culture of freedom and responsibility if
you're looking at the video this is what
her book looks like it's excellent she
served as the chief talent officer for
Netflix for 14 years and if you have
seen the Netflix culture deck that was
going around the internet for some time
that was of a large reputation a lot of
people were looking at it and and then
trying to refashion their own HR
departments based on what they were
reading in the deck Patti was one of the
architects of that deck and and her book
was fantastic and were lucky enough to
have her on the Bregman leadership
podcast Patti welcome thank you thanks
for having me so Patti tell us briefly
the story of the culture deck which sort
of started started it all in some ways
Reed Hastings is the CEO of Netflix and
I had worked at another company together
before and we grew through merger and
acquisition and eventually our biggest
competitor acquired us and so he made a
bunch of money and invested in a lot of
startups and Netflix was one of them and
when he decided to be CEO of Netflix he
called me up and said I want you to come
work with me and do this and I said no I
thought it was a really stupid idea
I thought DVDs in the mail was the
dumbest idea I had ever heard and be
early where where would blockbuster be
going I mean I mean it was at that time
DVD players cost $1000 and like who you
gonna send him to you and the three
other people you know who have DVD
players right I mean and second it was a
really tiny company and I didn't think
he needed me and third I you know I'd
already done a start-up with him so I
was consulting I'm like you know call
something that doesn't know what you're
talking about so I said why would I want
to do this give me one reason that would
compel me and he said this time what if
we were successful we created the
company we always dreamed of okay now
that's music to my ears right so I say
if you made to come you always dreamed
of what would it look like and he said
I'd come to work every day and want to
work with
these people in these problems pretty
good answer right so he says to me what
how would it be for you if we created
the company who ice dreamed of and I
said would it be cool if we were like a
great place to be from you know like
like if they had Apple on your resume oh
you're part of the Macintosh team or
your earlier Amazon or something like
that would that be a cool thing to do
and so we agreed on one thing that we
would do which this time we would write
it down we would write down what a great
company meant to us right so the first
thing we did was he got together with
the executives back in the day and
instead of writing down esoteric
aspirational values I wanted to ride
down behaviors right if we said we're
candid and open and honest what that
looked like how could you see it what
would you do if you did those things I
didn't want to talk right about
integrity and have people like right you
know I wanted to be like that's the
truth so that's the first chapter in the
Netflix culture deck we rewrote that in
the 14 years I was there six times and
so every chapter was built on the
chapter before if you go back and read
the PowerPoint presentation it's like
distinct segments and so Reid and I
would work on it the executive team
would work on it we'd send it out to
everybody in the company they could work
on it they could draft that you could
add to it so we worked on it for 10
years and we're driving to work one day
and Reid said hey I'm if this woman last
night she's this really cool company
called SlideShare I'm like uh-huh and he
goes and they they do PowerPoint slides
online like what a quick that's a great
idea I wonder what people are gonna put
out there and he said well I put the
deck out this morning okay it was
completely an internal onboarding
document this was not the treatise this
was not but here's how things should
work this is when you joined the company
you sat in a room with Rita and I and we
went through it and said hey by the way
here's what you should expect from each
other I freaked out I was like what when
you said transparency that's not what I
guess
oh my god Reid you're gonna scare away
all of our candidates and he said only
the ones we don't want you know it I
wish we had I wish we had been more
deliberate about it honestly because
once we did it once it was out there I
had no idea that it would go viral yeah
but it made it made interviews much
richer because we stopped talking about
were you qualified and we started
talking more about how do you like to
work and you know here's how it is it's
like when I remember now we're going
back probably 25 30 years but when when
in college when you know you have a
class and the assumption is everyone's
read the book and then you can have a
useful conversation about the book but
if no one's read the book and you're
just kind of going over the book then
the conversation becomes less
interesting so once the deck is out
there now I imagine you're sitting there
and having a conversation with people
that's more interesting about them in
relation to what so much so much I mean
you know and and it got into a lot of
subtleties about like you know how
responsible do you really want to be and
how comfortable are you when you get a
lot of freedom and are you willing to
you know speak up when you think things
aren't going well and have you ever done
that before and you know and how do you
think about getting that information out
of somebody who's really introverted
right I mean it was just it changed
everything for us and and since I've
been gone you know I've been gone six
years now I now look back at some of
those things and I realize all the
subtleties around it right that did that
when I was in there I didn't think about
like like for example we were like
adamant about being on time like if you
were tardy if you were late for a
meeting it was just like oh verboden
right and I never thought of that as a
value right until I left and I started
consulting the companies where CEOs were
consistently late
meetings with me and I'm like is your
product on time because like you maybe
show up on time but you know it was the
it was the behaviors it's how you behave
not what we wrote down right well and
you know it's funny because the work
that I do around recently a lot of
because I have a new book that's that's
out on emotional courage is about
closing the gap between what you say in
what you do right it's the difficult
things and and you're really talking
about that you're talking about you know
an ability to live the values that you
state and that you have yeah and it's in
a lot of you know are hard and they take
a lot of practice I mean it's it -
exactly what you're talking about you
know I do a lot of conversations around
feedback because I hate the annual
performance review and and what I say is
name one other thing you do once a year
in your life that you're good at and
said no one ever
right I mean like it just doesn't happen
it's a very well stated and people find
me really blunt right and they say when
they meet me oh you're so much nicer in
person than you sound in your book and
and I said look you know constructive
feedback has come to me in constructive
criticism which means telling somebody
something they don't want to hear in a
nice way instead of just this honest
exchange between us about how things are
going right that and and how you get
better at that as you practice right so
I wanna I have a couple of questions I
mean I have too many questions that
we're not going to get to but I think
what I want to do is give people a
little bit of a sense of what we're
talking about because I realize we're
talking about something that many people
haven't seen yet okay and so you know I
want to just throw out some of the
things you talk about you talk about
treating people like adults
right and and I'm curious about what you
mean by that and also why companies
don't treat people like adults and
what's the risk of treating people like
adults actually let me let me pause
there yeah let's set that up yeah okay
so so so you know talk to us about
about what it means to be an adult and
why it's so hard for companies to trust
people to act like adults what the risks
are
I mean maturity I I mean being
responsible
I mean having an opinion and owning your
decisions and wanting to make a
difference and taking work seriously and
you know it's funny because when you
know last year's
word de jour was millennial I would get
all these calls about Millennials and
they'd she'd say you know the reporters
would say oh you don't like Millennials
because you only like adults and I'd say
no no no no there's no correlation right
I know plenty of adult mature dedicated
hard-working 25 year olds and I know a
whole bunch of really immature
you know sideways talking 45 year olds
right so it's about the idea that you're
a responsible grown-up coming to work to
contribute to something with other
responsible grown-ups that's what I mean
by adult so everybody would say great
like I don't know anybody who would say
you know who wouldn't agree with you
that it's important to have a company
filled with adults and it's important to
be an adult yeah yet one of the things
that you're saying is companies don't
treat us in a way that assumes that we
will yeah I mean some of it comes from
the hierarchical top-down management
styles of the 60s that have somehow
clung to our companies even though
that's not how we operate at all anymore
and I spend you know I spend probably
half my time with little startups and
half my time now with huge corporations
who realize they're too slow and they
wonder how you know how can I come in
and tell them how to innovate and I say
well let's see how many layers of
permission do you have to have to get
anything done well at least five Michael
then throw away three right and they can
do it that's somebody's whole job to
give you permission
like that's and I say you know this
those people who are directing really
literally telling you what to do they're
not productive what if you got rid of
them and just asked the people do what
they should write so there's not a lot
of so that's where I think it comes from
right it's that hierarchy that says and
it's it's weird how its manifested
itself now it also assumes a hierarchy
of intelligence like the smartest people
are at the top and you know the dumbest
people are the more junior people when
you know I often see the complete
inverse because the you know people who
are fresh sometimes walk into a
situation and see the obvious where the
person who's looked at it over and over
again just can't even conceive it so I
think it's really detrimental and and it
forces that then we put in all this
structure and all this compliance and
all this policy and all these
permissions and we stifle the thing we
actually want which is people who stand
up and contribute because they want to
write
so I percent agree with you right and
and I think that the more were filled
with people who act like adults and
organizations the more successful every
organization will be and there will be
healthy debate and healthy conflict and
healthy support one of the things I see
in organizations all the time is people
who tend to act in their self-interest
or the self-interest of the silo that
they're operating in right it could be
piles it could be marketing it could be
ops it could be whatever versus in the
interest of the larger organization as a
whole
no it's honey it's not even that III I'm
gonna argue it's not even in the
interests of the larger larger
organization as a whole
okay the way the way you get to
selflessness is you act on behalf of the
customer or the client right or
whoever's using your part you know I
used to say to my team yes we are a
service organization it is not spelled
ser VA and TS right right and the people
we serve don't work here
the people we serve are your daughter
right who
who loves Netflix right and so then if I
looked at my team I would say okay so
here's what we're responsible for to
serve the customers we're responsible
for having a company full of amazing
people that are going to create a
fabulous service that's so intuitive
that you know toddlers can use it with
their fingers without reading right so
think about that so we are responsible
for everything that creates a pipeline
for that incredible talent to be here
and then get out of the way so that that
incredible talent can do.you can serve
our customers so that's where when you
when you pull away all of that you know
serving the organization and move it to
serving the customer the constituent or
the client right back that's my
philosophy basically that combined with
great place to be from right changes
everything right right those are the two
fundamental principles that are like the
way I think about work that's very
different then I'll tell you what to
think I'll tell you what to do and I'll
give you permission to do what we think
is important at the top so what gets in
the way let's just say almost everybody
listening to you would agree that that's
the way that people should operate what
gets in the way the way we've always
done it
we're just humans are such creatures of
habit and they don't see their
leadership behaving differently so you
know I I just do talk in Australia with
the executive leadership team of a huge
bank right and I mean these this snooty
snooty big bank in Australia and and I
said to them you know pick one thing
you're gonna do differently in this team
of ten people to show me what it looks
like and then all of you go do it for a
week that's how change happens right and
it has to be something that people will
notice right instead of saying when
somebody asks you a question you know
hey we want to know what you think we
should do about this just say for one
week well what do you think we
should do about this and if and if we
were me what information would you want
to have to make a good decision
second question more important than the
first just do that for a week right
right and it's so it's like you and I
talked about a little bit earlier it's
like it's practice right you have to
practice teaching people how to think
you have to practice giving up your
authority that you've earned right hey
and so that way of doing things is so
ingrained in us and so that my point is
people can't be what they can't see
right so unless they see other people
behaving differently or behaving as
adults or taking responsibility or
instead of saying oh yes well let me
give you that answer instead probing you
for the answer right those are the
things that have to change so where does
fear come in I see a lot of fear in in a
senior leadership even about almost you
know almost a responsive can we really
do that like can I really let people
choose their own vacation schedules I
mean that's a simple one but can can we
really you know like like yes they're
super smart people all across the
organization and and yet do we trust
that they really understand and hold the
vision the way we hold the vision you
you know I think about that bank and I
think you know I don't know what what
bank it is but I know that part of the
reason there's so much risk compliance
in banks is because you know one person
can bring the bank down right and it's
happened for a number of different banks
where oh listen you don't understand
we're regulated right right you
understand we're regulated I'm like does
it really it regulates the way you keep
track of the work people do show me the
statute that says that that's not
regulated
show me the regulation that says you
have to do an annual performance review
show me the regulation that says you
have to have paid time off for salaried
employees in America there isn't what
okay so let's step back and I answer
your question it's about changing the
way you manage
and so here's the things you have to be
really really good at in order to trust
people and give them responsibility and
freedom to do to make their own
decisions number one you have to make
your deliverables crystal clear people
have to know what goodness looks like
they have to know a timeframe so that's
an interesting one you know in when I go
to a startup I'll say now what's your
timeframe for accomplishing this
first of all I'll say tell me your
strategy and almost always they tell me
their plan right like that's a good plan
but that's not strategy a strategy is
what you don't do so what of all the
things that you could do which things
are you not gonna do and does everybody
know that right okay so give me your
strategy and then when's that gonna
happen and they'll say startup guys ago
well some day five year plan I'm like
until all that you know that it should
happen last year that blew up your
five-year plan right so so so it's about
setting really clear deliverables for
teams that are wrapped in timeframe who
they're serving what they're delivering
right so one of it is getting skills
around articulating not just the vision
but the deliverables like what's going
to take to do that and the second part
is that setting of context right and
that's the hardest part sometimes
because the way we're set up is the
higher up you go in the organization the
more privileged information you get
right and so part of your status is that
you know something somebody else doesn't
know right right that contributes to
your status I used to say that knowledge
is the cheapest form of power right I
know something you don't know and in and
that and letting go of that is very
difficult for people who spent their
whole lives achieving that secret status
but but if you want people to really
make their decisions they not only need
to know the stuff that they need to know
everything I mean literally everything
everything and the more you give them my
experiences the more you give them
information and permission to know
things even things that are secret the
more they'll keep it secret
right right because it's a trust factor
I mean if you want to build trust tell
somebody something and go really
honestly this is something that if our
competitors found out it would be very
detrimental to us you understand that
right because you understand the
competitors you understand what we're
building you understand now in a
timeframe is you understand what we're
trying to achieve right this is how
we're gonna serve the customer so you
know make sure that that stays here and
people will keep their yes I did
fascinating you know and these are all
experiments at Netflix I mean year after
year we try you know we went public what
we thought oh god you know what levels
are people are going to be able to see
what kinds of information right it's
typically what you do and instead we
closed the trading window very small and
we kept the information flowing and kept
our fingers crossed right and by and
large you know people gave back what we
gave to them right
yeah and it's it's like you you I think
a lot of times people put regulation and
for fear of that one person and yeah and
this isn't that crazy stuff right I mean
it's just that seems so crazy to me
you know I know ship I think you have to
be willing to say we're willing to have
that I mean we're gonna put regulation
to avoid this one person you know
toppling the whole enterprise but there
will be people who take advantage of our
vacation policy there will be yeah it
might be more people that take vacation
manage your vacation policy then there
are people who are that that 1% that I
mean reverse the thinking right that's
what I tell people I'm like okay drive
up in your Silicon Valley get out of
your car in your parking lot look around
at all those other cars and all the
people getting out of the buses and all
the people getting out of the Train and
say to yourself yep coming in to screw
me today
yeah right that's what they're they're
not all the thing that I I remember
hearing that I really love which is when
someone was saying look what if I train
my people you want me to pay all this
money to train my people what if I train
my people and they leave and and the
response was but you know see what a
fighting out of the alternative right
think of that
train them and they stay right yeah
that's why I named my book powerful
right because I hate the word
empowerment I think it's stupid I think
that we don't go around with the magic
wand empowering anybody and the reason
why we have to empower them is we took
it all away right so let's take the
vacation a example that you gave right
if you are in finance and you're an
important part of month and clothes and
quarter and clothes and year-end close I
would recommend that you probably want
to schedule your vacations right in the
middle of the month toward the middle of
the quarter or the middle of the year
right it's probably not really smart if
you're in payroll to take to what the
first two weeks in January off even
though you never get them off and it
doesn't seem fair what's there if you
want first two weeks in January off pick
another occupation right so is so you
it's that we called it freedom and
responsibility right so you're if you so
let's say let's take that example you
decide that you you know yeah enough of
this I don't care I'm taking the first
two weeks in January off because I'm
taking that ski vacation so they're
right so now I'm not firing you
I'm not saying goodbye to you because
you violated the time off policy I'm
saying goodbye to you because that's
really bad judgment right right right
and that's not every being a responsible
member of the team what you know no no
no I can't count on you because I don't
know if it the last minute you're just
gonna walk away so actually I don't
really want you on my team right right
and it's not because you violated the
policy right right I don't have to
protect myself from you and you know and
I should be able to find out beforehand
when I interview you you know where
you're like you know why I'm really glad
people tell me this people tell you this
stuff right Oh what are you looking
forward to what do you like best about
the company I love the idea that I can
take time off whenever I want cuz like
I've never had a ski vacation now I'm
coming here I'm taking the first two
weeks in January off I can say you could
take all of January off
have to be here January right but those
but that's what I was saying earlier
right those are the questions that we
should be asking people in the interview
process to determine how much people are
ok with that level of responsibility and
it it actually you know it the all these
pieces fit together because one of the
most critical things you do policy or
not is to create clarity of expectations
and clarity of alignment in order to
make sure that everybody's moving in the
same direction and if you're keeping
everything secret your job to create a
line I remember when I was in high
school and we were you know fighting for
something I can't remember what I was
fighting for but I think it was like to
get out of the building and we do I grew
up in New York and ahead of the school
you know I was in this heated meeting
with him and I was an advocate for the
students and he goes look there's stuff
you don't know about that you you know
that that that makes that impossible and
I'm like well then tell me about it
yeah and and and that's hard to let go
of right that's hard so that's why
bigger older companies have a harder
time doing that's why I'm saying it's
like so not only is this the way we've
always done it but in HR particularly
when we do stuff the way we've always
done it we call it best practices right
we don't measure it right it's like well
these are best practices and that
employees supposed to go oh thank you
and never ask why right right like like
compensation makes me crazy right the
the compensation survey that everybody
uses to benchmark their jobs against
other companies jobs and so I say to HR
people I'm like so tell me about your
comp and tell me about your compensation
well we target in the 65th percentile
I'm like okay that's a budget reason so
first of all let me be your employee who
gets the other 35% right well that's not
what percent on me and so I know that
you know that and no one else in the
whole world knows that right and oh by
the way you can't say
hire only a players and we pay in the
65th percentile in the same sentence
right right because yet the people who
get the other 35% are over at Google or
over it like Netflix or wherever need
that player in every single role you may
need them in some role but but let's
let's go back to my premise right ok so
that compensation survey that you use to
determine what the right 65th percentile
is for each and every job title in your
organization can I see it you can see
the data that you're using to determine
my salary oh no that's that's
confidential okay let's take salary
let's seek salary I remember it being an
executive meeting I'm like you know what
I think we should be more transparent
about so I think it's just one thing
it's the last vestige of like we got to
keep it secret stuff and the executives
would say you know oh my god there'll be
reads all people would be really upset
it's really gonna you know it's gonna be
so disruptive
you know people won't like it and I said
because but we can see everybody's
salary because we're executives and
we're really smart and smarter than the
average bear and we're used to seeing
big numbers and so it doesn't bother us
oh and everybody a payroll can see it
because what they're not very smart no
it's just numbers and by the way
everybody who goes to Glassdoor can see
it because ya know or every or every you
know engineer in the world loves to hack
into the salary database and they find
out they make more than other people but
you know what we're what we're what
we're really afraid to be transparent
about in salary is why why do I make
more than you what it will more off more
often why do you make more than me right
right I just did this talk with this
group of HR people 1500 of them and I
could I'm like the doors closed it's
just us and I'm one of you fix equal pay
I mean three most female dominated
departments in any company HR finance
and sales and marketing okay like if you
don't own pay who does all right so like
right
some Czechs who are you waiting to give
you permission to do right pipe
compensation and has it occurred to you
that the the very systems that we women
made up keep us keep us down right like
I'm screwin ourselves like it's time
flange about right you know whole lot of
steps gonna get fixed when people start
making what they're worth right just
fans so you know there's this sort of
for me is that's an example where I want
to say you don't have the power to fix
pay right yom-yom compensation right so
the way we've always done it isn't fair
it's not best practices it's not that
it's not the best to have women make
ninety cents to every guy's dollars they
call it we should call it past practice
not best practice yeah yeah so that's
that's deep into my philosophy which is
really it's best really are you sure how
do you measure that I love it Patti
McCord her book is powerful you can tell
that it comes from a deep and honest
place when you listen to her talk
building a culture of freedom and
responsibility Patti thank you so much
for writing the book and thank you so
much for being on the Bregman leadership
podcast well thank you so much for
having me

Finding a New Way to Work | Patty McCord
it's well known if you read the book you
get more on this but you in the
leadership you strip some things away as
you begin to intentionally design a
culture I love that it took ten years I
think that is you know that's not a
romantic number when people hear that
you know it wasn't days or ten weeks it
was ten years to get that deck you know
and I think that's realistic yeah my
entrepreneurial CEOs are like right
exactly yeah well good luck jr. so yeah
well you know and it's hard work it is
it is well and one of the things you did
is you did examine every rule every
process the bureaucracy so the flow or
positions and all that good stuff what
happened take us through some scenarios
some stories that poeple and when you
begin to deconstruct it and strip things
away okay so we had we had written the
chapter on high performance I had really
high performing people on the team we're
about to go we went public the auditors
come the Sox guys come you know there's
consultants everywhere in auditors
everywhere and they say we don't like
your time off policy which what it was
at the time was you accrued a day a
month and it was an honor system so when
you left the company I'd say what do we
owe you and you'd tell me and I'd pay
you so the auditors didn't like that
because you know technically it's all
falling to the bottom line and I'm
paying everybody thirteen months a year
and they don't like that the Sox guys
don't like it cuz it's not standard
issue you know you get Christmas off and
Thanksgiving off and right so they
wanted to say here's a policy we like do
this and this true story I'm sitting in
my office and Reid comes in and I'm
cranky about it because I don't like
either either solution he says do you
have to have paid time off and the HR VP
on my left shoulder I really really used
to be an HR person I want you to know
this says of course you have to have
paid time off read everybody's got paid
time off
and the other person who lives inside of
the innovative company called Netflix
says you mean legally mm-hmm
I don't know so I go and do a bunch of
research and as I'm doing the research
I'm thinking about time off right and
I'm thinking have I ever said goodbye to
you know a salaried employee because
they've been tardy or absent no right
in fact I've said goodbye to people who
work all the time and don't get anything
done mm-hmm you know and the people who
work all the time they're weird you
really don't want somebody who spends
their whole life at work in their life
and then everything gets so drama about
it so I stopped in thought and why would
I have to hire people on my team to
police the time that you spend on your
team right and and that that the real
managing of time happens locally and the
real measurement of time is what gets
done right so if you say wow this team
is consistently late in delivering then
you might reverse engineer that another
term I learned from the geeks I hung
around with if I reverse engineer why
this time is this team is consistently
not meeting its objectives
is it a they're not very good at
projecting or they're not honest when
when they say how long is it gonna take
for you to deliver B do they have the
wrong team
si are they not putting in the time it
takes to do it right but all of those
answers are legitimate and they have
nothing to do with whether or not you
take Christmas off mm-hmm yeah that's
good plus I had this huge diverse staff
right and I'm gonna say oh yeah forget
about Hanukkah unless it's close to
Christmas right or you know or that your
culture celebrates something that
happens the second week in January so
that's that's when I just started
thinking logically about it I thought
well maybe I don't need a time off
policy and here's what really happened
iced
in front of the employees and I said
we're thinking that you're grown-up
enough to take to keep track of time
within your own teams well we're gonna
keep track of is do you get done what
you say you get done does it serve the
customer does it make the company better
now if what all the lawyers and
everybody else tells us that will happen
happens which is it's gonna be chaos you
guys aren't gonna do any work nothing's
ever gonna happen there's gonna be
people gone all the time
we'll have lawsuits because people are
treated differently then we'll go back
to the way everybody else does it we'll
do best practices in the meantime I'm
gonna trust you to do the right thing
and giving people that ownership and
that trust oh man that is so much more
effective than a policy mmhmm yeah give
us an example give us an example of
somebody you remember or maybe you heard
a report from a leader who said patty
this is how they reacted to that when
you stood up or however that was
communicated corporately what was the
initial response and then maybe second
part of that question is what was the
long-term response well the initial
response was a little bit of confusion
right does that mean we don't get time
off right like you really just is this a
is this a fake way of just saying work
all the time so I had to tell this story
of like people who work all the time are
weird and we really don't want you to be
weird right and the second part was like
how do okay if you're gonna give this to
me as a team manager what are what's the
right thing to do in in my team so I had
a so an example was this person came
down and she said I've been elected to
come tell you about what we're doing in
our team because we think that when you
find out we're gonna be in trouble I'm
like oh really you know what is it I'm
thinking this could be really juicy and
she said we have a vacation schedule we
post it inside the cubicle so you won't
see it when you walk by and it's color
coded visible why do you do that and she
said we're on call like well that makes
complete sense to me right it
I didn't say don't don't do the right
thing you know so that you can get your
work done I said do the thing that
matters to you to get your work done
right so and you know later on what
people did so I had this reporter come
in and he he spent the day with me
finding out about what he thought was
gonna be this Google like perk right at
the end of the day comes and he goes
well here's the deal you know this is
not a good story at all you know what
people do like yeah well they do I don't
know so I don't keep track of it he said
they take the same time off they always
did if they have kids you know they go
to their plays and and they go to their
events and they take some time off in
the summer and some time and all the
paid holidays right all the holidays
their kids get off and if they're young
and they're single they save up their
time and they go hiking in Nepal and I'm
like oh yeah me I love three-day
weekends right and his I said so what
did they say about it and he said they
said nothing's really different it's
just wonderful that I own it yes right
there's somebody else isn't telling me
what to do I'm getting my work done
around what I need in my life and so he
goes there's no story here so I said hey
you know you've been hanging around with
me all day and you could go back to the
newspaper and they might think you've
been at the beach so how are they gonna
know that you did what you were supposed
to do just like excuse me and I said
because you're gonna write this story
and it's gonna have the right amount of
words and it's gonna be well at it isn't
it's gonna pack a punch and it's gonna
be a good story like you always turn it
that's how they'll know it's done mm-hmm
I said you ever go to the newspaper
office and he turns around and he says
yeah I do occasionally and he said to do
what if he goes to submit my vacation
request oh oh wow is rich so you think
about man particularly journalists now
when I turn it back on them you know
it's like oh yeah that's right I'm
completely independent yeah that's right
and it makes good sense
you

Patty McCord explains how to recruit the right person for the role | Tenfold Australia Masterclass
so when you start with the problem that
you want to solve
then you're going to be really looking
for somebody who can not only
cannot only do it but do it in the time
frame but is passionate about it
what innovators do is they say what
would be the
optimum customer experience right what
would be the
what would be if you could have nirvana
what would it look like and then they
work backwards from there
so i have a very distinct methodology
about
creating teams i say in six months
if your team was amazing i mean not just
better i mean
amazing whatever it is your global team
your marketing team your
whatever team it is that you are
responsible for
if it was amazing in six months time is
really important
what's occurring then that's not
occurring now and then i then you want
to give me all your metrics how you
measure it what does success look like
how are you gonna
is it revenue is it profit is it
whatever and then i say make a movie of
it
what's really occurring differently
especially now
right are we working from home a bunch
because we turned it turned out that
that was a really good thing to do and
we don't want to stop doing that
is it that we're traveling more or less
probably less if you're coming to the
u.s
right i mean so what does it look like
what's occurring differently that's
occurring now
then you drop down and you say okay what
would people need to know how to do in
order to do that
and you might find especially now that
some of your best people that work
and communicate remotely aren't the
person
aren't the people who command the room
yes
right you know i think the wonderful
thing about what's happening now is
we're starting to realize
the contributions that the quiet people
make that the people who just
get stuff done without having to tell
them what to do make right okay
so now you drop down you say okay in
order to do that in six months
what would skills and experience would
it take for people to need to know how
to do that in order to accomplish that
in six months
and then and only then who do you have

armstrong how are you rich very good
thanks steve good to have you afternoon
everyone i am really excited about
today's guest patty mccord she is the
author of powerful building a culture of
freedom and responsibility patty was a
key confidant of the founder reed
hastings and the head of hr at netflix
during its rise in her book she credits
reading the great game of business by
jack stackable birlingham for inspiring
netflix to adopt transparency and
education when it came to the company's
financials and its strategic goals
according to powerful a big part of
netflix secret to success in shifting
first to subscription model and then
later to the digital streaming
was that it practiced open book
management every employee from their
engineers to their customer service
agents was taught how the how how the
business made money in other words they
focus strictly on building a business of
business people patty also writes in her
book that she preferred the title of
chief product manager of people because
she understood that her role was not to
enforce policies or procedures but it
was also to help teach every netflix
employee how his or her actions impacted
the business so
welcome patty and we thank you for
joining us how are you i i'm great
thanks for having me i'm glad to be here
fantastic fantastic well let's start
with your book um
what was your inspiration in writing the
book your latest book uh powerful what
was the inspiration
you know i just start i left netflix and
i thought i would find other people
doing some really interesting
experiments around how we manage people
and the honest truth is
i didn't find much that was different
and so
i wanted to talk about the things that
we had done and giving people
freedom and responsibility and using
good judgment to do the right thing and
i thought it was important that i write
it to help people understand that yes
you can do it differently because i did
yeah awesome
you specifically wrote a chapter in your
book patty that
that focused on the need for
every single employee to understand the
business and um i know you you shared a
little bit of you just did it right you
just went out and did it
why was it so important at netflix i
mean
why
well partly we were making up a business
that nobody had ever done before and we
were also creating a subscription
business which was really unusual in our
space right
you're used to a gym subscription or a
magazine subscription but the idea of
subscribing to a dvd by mail service is
really different so that's thing one
thing two was um
i was just really interested in how it
was working so we used to have a meeting
every friday in our parking lot we
called it the metrics meeting and
literally what we would hand out would
be the equivalent of what in most
companies is the executive dashboard
right it would have what's the revenue
what's our cost per shipment
it was basically
we taught people how to read a p l
without explicitly
saying we're going to teach you how to
do this and we and we just assumed
honestly we just assumed that everybody
was smart enough to understand it and if
we thought somebody wasn't then why were
they working with us
interesting that's that begs a question
a little further deep dive did you ever
do any formal financial literacy
training or was it just the informalness
of those kind of parking lot huddles it
was the informalness of those parking
lot huddles and sometimes you know we
would get a question at the parking lot
huddle that we realized
needed a bigger deep dive and then what
we might do is have our cfo stand up in
the parking lot huddle and say let me
explain revenue and profit metrics to
you oh we don't have any profit
but here's but here's how the
subscription model works with building
on the base that builds over time and
the beautiful thing about focusing on
how the business worked
was it created a secondary incentive
that i never thought about until much
later which was
because we had a subscription business
the only way we could keep going was to
have our our customers be
extraordinarily happy right because you
want to keep signing up right so what we
did what we realized is through teaching
people about how all the mechanisms
worked they knew that everybody's
literally everybody's job was to make a
customer so happy that they would keep
coming back
and that keep coming back was an
essential part of the subscription
business model
amazing yeah you know there's a lot of
talk about employee engagement patty you
know you know there's no question that
hey engaged employees are probably going
to give you better more performance but
it was interesting in your book how you
communicate you you talked about how
communicating and teaching employees how
their work actually contributed to the
success of the business was actually the
most
engaging thing you could do to create
some engagement in their work can you
talk a little bit about why that was so
effective
i think humans are basically motivated
by doing great work with amazing
colleagues i mean i've been doing what i
do for over 30 years and
you know every engagement survey in the
world that says people are likely to
recommend doesn't mean they're likely to
love their job or feel great about the
work that they're doing and so you know
here's another funny thing about
engagement just you know it's one of
those words i hate um
you know
when i talk to people who you know
deeply rely on the employee engagement
survey and net promoter scores and all
that kind of stuff i sometimes say go
find five people in your company that
are amazing that everybody knows are
amazing you know you we all have some of
those people and sit down with them and
say tell me about the time that you did
something that made a difference to our
company or our customers tell me about
something that you're really proud of
and every one of those stories is going
to be about something hard
and so when we talk about engagement we
usually mean that people
are loving what they're doing and it's a
little bit outside of their comfort zone
and the achievement at the end is what
really motivates people not that we're
inciting people to be engaged
to reiterate what you just said to make
sure i fully understand it you're
actually kind of breaking the old um
engagement myths or beliefs as ari said
earlier in our conference and saying
engagement is actually better when you
take people outside their comfort zone
that's where growth happens is that what
you were saying that's exactly what i'm
saying
out of my comfort zone right now
well you know
somebody asked me the other day about um
debating right and wasn't it so there's
a there's a
part of the netflix culture that's about
um debate vigorously in order for a
great customer experience right if
you're debating on behalf of that
customer experience you can do a lot of
stuff and somebody said to me the other
day um wasn't that really uncomfortable
i'm like oh god i love nothing better
than being in a meeting where somebody
changes my mind
wow right you know it's like oh you're
right you're right yeah
is powerful
yeah i mean that that intellectual
stimulation
is is i think what really motivates
people and that's why i think the
underpinnings of
you know if you really know
what your role is in the organization
you really know how the machine works
then you get this sense of pride because
you know what you contribute and in your
case at netflix
the culture of trust that's developed
because there are so few rules it's
really more as i think you told us
context
the idea is the the more i'm trusted the
more i have a chance to be trusted
it feeds itself which is really
counter-intuitive for most business
people
yeah it was for me too to be fair you
know i mean there was i always there is
this like little actual vp of hr on my
left shoulder and on my right shoulder
was the person who worked for an
engineer who always said why why why why
why
and
you know every time we would break a
rule or try something
tell people something that nobody else
would say we would say to them
look we think you're smart we think you
understand what we're trying to do we
think you're uh
you guys are all high performers so if
this is a secret we expect you to keep
it
and it just turned out that that
that's empowerment
right that's when you say to people i i
trust you to do the right thing for the
company and then they do
and that i mean it's much better than
waving that magic wand and saying you're
empowered right
then you beat someone with
that's right right well you know
you know i always say that the reason
why we have to go around empowering
people is because we took it all away
yeah
right
all those rules and all the people that
you have to ask permission from and all
the approvals that you have to get and
all the guidelines that you have to
follow
you know so that we protect ourselves
from that
two percent of people who
aren't going to do the right thing
and you know one of the sayings we used
to have at netflix was
i i would say it this way i'd say you
know when you're talking to somebody and
there's kind of this bubble over their
head and you think to yourself this
person is clueless
close your eyes and count to ten and say
yeah that may actually be true
right they just don't know right and
when you do that and you say i'm talking
to a smart person who does great work
and cares about the company and they
appear to not know what at all they're
talking about then i can say to them
that's an interesting perspective what
leads you to believe that's true
and then you can understand where
they're coming from and you realize oh
they don't have the full picture because
they just don't know
and then it's our responsibility as
leaders to provide that context
all the time
all the time i mean it's just
how we became how we managed over time
you know this and the way we came up
with managing at netflix we didn't
decide one morning when we woke up
um if anybody's read the netflix culture
deck that took us 10 years
to write
years
and um and so what we did was we would
experiment and then you know if the
world didn't fall apart then that would
embold us to experiment more but i will
say that the boldest things i ever did
or we ever did as an executive team
wasn't necessarily to do
things invent things
it was mostly around just stopping doing
things that didn't matter
yeah right replacing that for example
you have to get approval from finance to
expand x number of dollars
instead of teaching people here's how
the business works here's what our
budgetary constraints are here's what
you know here's the profit percentage
here's our fixed cost here's all so make
your decisions
do good judge make your spending
decisions within the context of those
parameters
and smart people can do that yeah
so true for sure
what what are your thoughts about
engaging so-called
millennials like steve
can you hear me
i'm sorry
[Laughter]
what are your thoughts about engaging
so-called millennials like steve baker
over here
i don't buy it
i i just don't buy the whole millennial
thing i mean come on guys you were a
millennial i was a millennial we're not
anymore but we were once early in our
career and what do you want when you're
20 something and starting in your career
everything when do you want it now
so that's like it's just called you know
starting out right and um
and i
i'm more in favor of talking about
maturity and judgment
so i have met and know
many many hard-working really smart
dedicated terrific
20-something-year-old employees and i
know a bunch of
lazy
yeah
you know not very immature 45 year olds
so it's a matter of i think that
it's perfectly reasonable for us to look
at employees in terms of where they are
in their career and what they come into
the business with right and i've found
for me that i've learned so much
about
you know i've learned everything i know
about social networking from young
people including my own millennial
children right who are by the way the
term millennials kind of old passe now
because my millennial children are in
their 30s now
yeah exactly
you know why i have a grandchild now he
doesn't he's not taking a job for
you know happy hour on friday afternoon
at three
so there's no kegerator in kindergarten
is what you're saying well you know
let's be realistic bring it to now you
know what he's pining for is an hour in
his car alone because he's got a
one-year-old 24 7 working from home yeah
yeah i think a lot of people are feeling
that patty
yeah
if i could let's delve into that because
i i was at a conference last year i
mentioned it sometimes when i'm speaking
where i was on a panel with younger
people and more diverse people than
myself and one of the things that came
out was um i i brought up ruby payne and
this understand framework for
understanding poverty i don't know if
you're familiar with it but there was a
really contentious thing about well you
can't put people in buckets like that
and then the whole millennial thing came
out if we just strip away
all of the the labels and we talk about
uh the differences between people i love
how you put it i know some pretty
motivated young people i know some
pretty lazy older people um can you just
expound on that a little bit for us
about how you tend to deal with it and
in the in this picture and i know this
is uh
kind of a long rambling question but
bear with me
so
the netflix culture basically says you
can be awesome um or you can be mediocre
but if you're mediocre we'll give you a
great severance package something like
that so it's like
what what about like jack stack i think
if he were on the the call with us here
he might say well you know should you
pay more attention and invest in their
training and bring them up i don't know
exactly but could you talk about that a
little bit because where do you draw the
line i'll give you a long rambling
answer excellent excellent
cheers
let me bracket it first
the first thing as a leader you need to
understand
is what you're trying to accomplish as a
team and what your time frame for
accomplishing it is
which is where
jack and i might completely agree if we
have somebody who's faltering a little
and they're just they're close they need
some help and the time frame is a couple
of years then absolutely that's worth
doing
but if you say i want my team to be
exceptional let's use the time frame six
months by the end of the year middle of
next year we're going to be awesome and
amazing right absolutely incredible then
ask yourself what would be occurring
then that's not occurring now right and
give me all your metrics because you
know we're financial people right so
we're going to get we're going to find
is it more revenue is it more growth is
it more customers is it better
interaction with the customers is it
better collaboration within the
organizations is it people that are
customer facing more than internal what
is it what is it on your team when it's
amazing in six months
okay
now you drop down and say oh okay um in
order to accomplish that
what would people need to know how to do
and maybe it's that you've gotten really
successful and you're growing step
functionally and you need to grow um
you need to look at you know problems of
scale right and the thing about problems
with scale is they're best solved by
people who've seen something bigger
right i mean it's hard to imagine 100x
if you've only seen 10 right okay so now
we think okay in six months we're going
to need to have the capability of doing
that then you drop down and say uh what
kind of skills and experience would it
take for someone to have that ability in
order to accomplish that in six months
and then and only then who do you got
so now
but now you're saying okay and the
netflix story i tell around this is
we had grown 30 percent quarter of a
quarter three quarters in a row
compounded i mean wow okay talk about
that happy stuff right so we go into an
executive meeting and reid wants to talk
about you know what if it goes to hell
he loves disaster planning i'm like what
if we just talked about like what if it
kept up right like what if we kept doing
it cfo goes a whiteboard he does you
know compounded top line revenue 30
year for year right he's like he's doing
that happy dance at cfo's like oh my god
it's so much money and ted sarandos
who's the head of content he's now the
co-ceo of netflix at the time we would
say to ourselves
someday
someday we'll be as big as hbo
someday
and we meant like in our lifetimes and
ted looks at the numbers and he goes
it's next year
wow
we could be as big as hbo next year and
our head of engineering says
by the way that will represent a third
of the us internet bandwidth
like what
shocked us right and then he and i got
together afterwards and i said oh my god
do we know how any do we have anybody
that knows how to do that
and he's like
no and i said can we do it in our data
center he goes
no it has to be in the cloud so we go to
rit guys we're like explain the
situation they're like no worries you
guys go exact something we'll build the
cloud
nice
and i said you know if anybody on earth
could do it it's probably you not nine
months
i mean i can't right we didn't even buy
the equipment in nine months right we
had a data center and so
it began the conversation that we could
have where you know somebody looked at
me in that meeting and said are you i've
been here seven years
are you telling me i might not be part
of this team and i said i
i don't know but we've got nine months
to figure it out
and that's what i'm saying once you
realize so for me
the experience wasn't necessarily that
somebody had their their high
performance suddenly shifted to low
performance
it was typically that the business
changed around them and they were still
high performing
in the job we hired them to do not
necessarily the job going forward i'm a
great example of that at netflix i'm a
tech gal i'm a silicon valley person i
really love engineers i left the company
when the company was changing to
yet another iteration which was about
original content globally
right so it's not that i didn't do a
pretty great job for the 14 years i was
there i was just not the best person for
the company going forward so i what the
reason i'm telling my long-winded answer
is
when you determine what the deltas are
and the problems that you're trying to
solve
and the problems you're just trying to
solve that becomes the requisition
right because here's how most people
write job descriptions they describe the
person that i left that wish they hadn't
and a fantasy person that doesn't exist
or whatever it takes to get it approved
none of which actually help you find a
pretty unhealthy
but if you look at that particular
problem problem you're trying to solve
within the time frame you're trying to
solve it
then you're going to be
way more open to hiring different kinds
of people to solve it yep
you know and what we tend to do is say
we have a lot of more work to do we're
going to need a lot more people who are
smart quick on their feet really good
decision makers technically people like
me
yeah
that's how you hire and then you wonder
why you can't get anything good yeah
because if you could have gotten it done
you would have yep yeah right so my
experience is
that very often the situation is outside
of the person's purview
or the person is like gets another
opportunity that's terrific or they
don't want to do that anymore they want
to do something different and if you
can't if you have another part of the
organization that can absorb that person
great
but if you don't you don't and there's
no harm no foul there right yeah right
excellent stuff thanks for going into
that because i think you just
effectively put in i mean everybody
that's listening everybody that's
watching is wondering about the the the
what and the why and then there's the
who that does a combination of all that
so you really covered all that very well
thank you for going deeper on that for
us
um i see we have a few minutes left
before the break um
i know rich you probably had another
question i wanted yeah i wanted to just
switch gears just a bit i know this is a
this is a pretty can you hear me all
right by the way
a little bit okay yeah okay i'll try to
speak up
um
but i want to shift gears just a bit
because you know that with this
conference as we talked earlier that the
theme of it is capitalism reimagined
right and capitalism in a lot of ways is
getting challenged continues to get
challenged and i won't call it the
millennials i call it the new workforce
maybe have a different kind of
perception about capitalism i was just
curious what your thoughts were on that
for for one but also
how could we maybe change that
perception a bit
i think we just have to change some of
the words we use in some of the dialogue
right um and i it
and i maybe we have to throw out
capitalism i mean maybe the isms are
just bad words right now um but what
i've found is that people can get
passionate
about the work they do as long as they
know who they serve
so in my organization my hr organization
i would say to them yes we are a service
organization
but it's not spelled s-e-r-v-a-n-t-s
right the people that we serve don't
work here
the people that we serve are the person
who checks you out in the grocery store
or your kid's teacher or your
grandmother right those are the people
that we serve and so what we want to do
is make sure that we have an incredible
team of people that are able to make
product for those consumers that make
them love it and hear stories from all
around the world right that's our job is
to deliver stories and so i think when
we start talking to people about the
work that we do we have to talk about
who who we serve right why we're there
and you know capitalism exists to create
goods and service that people want to
exchange their hard earned money for
and so as long as we respect that
transaction and the other part is back
to how we started this conversation
most people don't understand that's
right it's a true story i i'm
interviewing this woman this is back in
the dot com
boom bust you know 10 years ago
and i'm interviewing a woman she's the
vp of marketing at a very small startup
that's going bust and i said um
help me understand how your business
works you know help me understand some
of the mechanics of of your business
model and she says well i i'll tell you
one thing
i know that you can have
revenue without profit but not
profit without revenue
it's like
yeah
you boy you
hit that one right on the head
but she didn't know
and that was the end it wasn't like no
it was totally the end but but it was
but and she was a vice president now it
was a very small company and all that
kind of stuff but i mean
people go through
enormous amounts of time in their
careers before they understand how it
works
so you know what you guys are talking
about i'm just fully in favor of because
that's how people understand
right i mean i have these i have
i have millennial children too my my
daughter was telling me the other day
that um
billionaires were lizard brains
and i said really reed and patty or
lizard brains she's like it is not fair
that because i know you that i actually
come in contact with humans who are
billionaires yeah i would i would prefer
to think about them in the complete
abstract wow
but that's part of it right i mean it's
part of it is that
people aren't exposed to it and it and
in your if you have a company if you're
a leader of a company it's really really
important that
everyone in the company sees you
being adult an adult
behaving in a way that's respectful of
who you serve as customers
and so that congress say if we just
stick stay away from it's all about the
money
which it's not
yep yeah
it's just my experience that it's i mean
people like money don't get me wrong and
you know a lot of money will keep
somebody longer than not a lot of money
yeah but
i i get it you know i don't you
yeah
for your passion too yeah totally well i
think it's i think it's interesting
patty that you
are really it sounds like what you're
saying is that one part of the solution
here to change that that that narrative
is that
you have to teach people the business
right you have to they have to
understand the game that we're in and it
was kind of interesting when i was
reading your book you were talking about
that when you first started to spread
this idea of transparency and education
through the company
that you had some executives that really
had kind of a bias that hey
these people don't want to know this
information or they probably wouldn't
even get it even if we taught them can
you talk a little bit about that
challenge oh sure there's there's always
the mba bias
right the only people that can
understand this kind of complexity are
the stanford mbas i mean that's you know
as close as stanford and um and then you
know i would take my stanford mba
executives and put them in front of a
group of say
you know call center reps
and say
you know explain marketing to these guys
and they would be ask really great
questions like okay fine see
i mean um i think it's an inherent bias
in any organization because
uh because that's the way it's always
been
yeah yeah for sure yeah you know
you could we could say the same about
women and
minorities and
you know we could have another whole
podcast
exactly well i do like the universal
appeal of you know what we're so
passionate about which is uh what you
all have been talking about uh here in
the last couple of minutes is there is
one universal thing and that's
understanding how money works and those
financials have been around for 500
years why don't we teach everybody this
but we don't
so well you know it's not just i i've
done a lot of work recently with
non-profits i mean they have a they have
financials too absolutely
all we're all subject to them patty
mccord thank you so much for joining us
author of powerful
uh building a culture of freedom and
responsibility patty you are amazing
thanks so much thank you

Fully-Formed Adults | Patty McCord | FranklinCovey clip
and when I say fully formed adults where
I talk about it those I'm not talking
about age because I've seen really
mature 20 year olds that are really
capable of doing really important work
that matters and I see really immature
for tribals right so I mean people who
are you know grownups they're
responsible they have and and in every I
also mean in every job I mean people
have mortgages and they have cars and
they have families and they have you
know responsibilities outside of work so
I think it's really foolish to think
that when somebody walks in the door
that they separately lose all that
responsibility right and so I think that
you can tell in an interview whether or
not somebody's going to feel responsible
for the work that they do and make sure
that you only hire those people that do

Building a Culture with Purpose - Patty McCord (ex Netflix) | National Employment Week 2016
hi everyone so guys we're on to the
final keynote speech stroke interview
stroke discussion stroke bit of crack uh
for the next hour um with somebody we're
really really really excited to have in
town somebody who we've been um pushing
pulling lobbying uh threatening to come
to Ireland for the last three years
nearly but just to introduce before
introduce Paddy just want to tell a very
quick story that I think is quite
relevant and poignant given Where We Are
100 years
ago 100 years ago this month a document
was being prepared in this city within
one mile of this building there was a
document being written a document with
the ultimate purpose the theme of this
week is building a culture with purpose
the purpose of this document in my mind
was the ultimate
purpose it was about the freedom and
responsibility of a Nation the freedom
and responsibility of this country the
proclamation of Independence was written
one month when in this month 100 years
ago at the heart of this document it was
about opportunity for all its people it
was about
equality and was about
autonomy a lot in this document was
mirrored in fact in the Declaration of
Independence in United States and we
know a lot about the core values of the
US around Freedom around pursu of
happiness and in my mind there's a lot
within these documents that are truly
truly transformative that document um as
it goes and that purpose came to life in
this room three years later when the
first Irish Parliament sat in this very
room so it's an interesting concept to
have a beacon with a very clear purpose
to ultimately create something that's
defined around cultural
identity Patty mccort who many of you
know and those you who don't know was
the co-author of the freedom and
responsibility document in Netflix she
was the ex Chief Talent officer in
Netflix and just to give you a bit more
color in terms of what she's done Beyond
Netflix um we were setting up this week
and we built the National Employment
week H website on GitHub you all know
GitHub we marketed the event through
HubSpot we ticketed the event through um
through Eventbrite and then this week a
lot of tweets going out I thought bran
Cody was trending earlier
on and we have a number of prey
presentations all of those companies
Patty has consulted with and worked with
and has shaped and worked in in driving
the
culture and a lesser known story we were
in go two nights ago and Patty got she
experienced the West was awake um and
was good crack in go went back to the G
Hotel I said look with interest in
Patty's a Lady Gray crack and uh I said
look I just take 10 minutes out and just
just kind of D Netflix myself sat there
in the hotel room picked up the remote
control Netflix button on the remote
control you know so it's omnipresent to
use a word that David mentioned on so
I'd like to introduce our keynote Steph
P
[Applause]
mord when he introduces me like that I
kind of want you all to sing the Irish
national anthem you know and then I
could get kind of weepy
and are we sitting we're in for it
aren't we we're in for take a seat there
party what they said say again what they
said what who said the last panel was so
great wasn't it that was really great
great I'm pretty far away from you let's
do a quick F around let's do it let's do
it okay Arland in three
words
oo
rainy um warm people is that did I use
up all my words plenty words scope um
exciting I mean I'm just it feels like
I'm home with all similar companies
similar challenges it's great to be in a
place where things are going well and
you're excited about the future it's
wonderful a lot of companies you've
worked with lot of companies I've worked
with it's sort of like I know you I know
your counterpart in Sunny Bale
hi next question your most admired
business
leader my current admired business
leader is Cheryl Sandberg um she's been
through a lot personally and I think
she's done that really well and I think
she's sort of undervalued at Facebook
you know Mark Zuckerberg gets sort of
all the glory and I think Cheryl's one
of the people that does a lot of the
work and the work that she did with
leanin is just really profoundly
impactful I think to this generation of
feminists so rock on Cheryl most
overhyped
company uh right now my current
overhyped company is Snapchat chat but
you know I spend a lot of time with
companies who are the Netflix of right
subscriptions
snacks subscription dog food whatever
those things are and you know who knows
the thing is I don't want to be cynical
about that stuff because when we started
Netflix my friends are like
uhhuh yeah that sounds really
stupid you invented it be careful what
you wish for py I know well look that
brings that brings us on to Netflix so
let's go for it so 2:00 in the morning
read Hastings CEO Netflix called you
what did he say okay A little background
before I do the 2 o'clock in the morning
call Reed and I worked at another
company before Netflix it was a software
tools company Reed wrote the first
product for the company so let me just
say that underneath that polished
professional CEO that you see on TV is a
complete nerd right this is a geek so
it's 2 o'clock in the morning he's like
hi are you sleeping like of course geek
I'm normal it's 2 o'clock in the morning
and we had sold the company before and
Reed made a pile of money and um he had
started Angel Investing in a bunch of
companies and he said hey by the way I'm
going to go and join Mark who's
co-founder of Netflix and run the
company I said okay sounds like a good
career move can I go back to sleep now
why are you telling me this at 2: in the
morning and he said um because I want
you to come too and I said no I'm not
going to do that first of all I already
know what you're asking me to do because
I already did a startup with you so why
don't you call somebody that doesn't
know what you're talking about two you
know seriously DVDs in the mail you guys
may not know about this but that was the
original idea for Netflix in the US I'm
like that's just the dumbest idea I ever
heard of and three what it is that you
want me to do and he said I want you to
be my VP of HR I said for God's sake
Reed there's 30 people you don't need me
I'm going back to bed he's like wait
let's make the company we always dreamed
of okay for those of you who are HR
people in the room is that music to your
ears and I said well if we did that uh
how would you now a I'm awake B if we
did that how would you know and he said
oh I'd walk in the door every day and I
would love solving these problems with
these people I'm like yeah it's good
it's hard to talk because how what would
you say and I said wouldn't it be great
if we were a great company to be from
you know if you saw Netflix on your
resume you'd be like wow you're at
Netflix and I I just saw him a couple
weeks ago we went to Sundance together
and every time I see them I'm like we
both got our wish we both got our wish
so to create a company to be from yeah
quite
powerful did you achieve
it yeah for sure I mean I spend um
because I have time now which I didn't
have when I was sort of heads down for
14 years at Netflix I spend a lot of L
of time with alum and um you know it's
like I don't want to use the family
metaphor because I don't believe in that
with work but I'm so proud of the the
things that people have achieved that
have worked for us I mean you know
sprinkled out into the world all these
little seeds of the culture and the
leadership and the ideas that people
have yeah I asked you during the week
we're chatting did you ever consider
going back into the corporate world I
after Netflix and you commented that
lightning doesn't strike Twi yeah what
did you mean by buy oh I think I had so
I'm kind of a I ended up I started out
in big companies and then I ended up in
the startup world and that's where I
knew I had died and gone to heaven and
so I realized that I was a bit of a
serial entrepreneur and I used to tell
Reed that I you know I time out at four
years it's like about on the fifth year
of a company I'm like yeah I kind of
figured it out this is kind of boring
I'm going to move on and the thing about
Netflix I was there 14 years was I
actually had three tours of Duty at
Netflix the first one was could we come
up with a business model before we went
broke that took about four years the
second one was our DVD by mail in the US
business um that took another four or
five years and the third business was
our streaming business which you all are
aware of now um and right now Netflix is
involved in global streaming and
original content which is yet another
business so I got lucky because I got
you know three different businesses in
one company and I think that'd be really
hard to duplicate let's talk about the
document py so so I'm sure a lot of you
have read it not all let I want to show
hands who's read Netflix culture deck
okay that's helpful yeah okay um so just
to explain it do you want to explain the
Genesis of it maybe and give us a sense
of how it evolved so you know I just
told you that we wanted to create this
great company and we realized that um
culture and greatness um and the things
about about how we work together are
only achieved if you pay attention to it
and I know that sounds really
straightforward and logical but you know
how it is when you get busy with all the
other stuff that's happening in your
business you're like we ought to
get to that culture thing
Sigmar Robert says every time I swear I
have to say Sigmar so then she said to
me okay when I say it I want to say
 Sigmar Sigmar am I done
right uh okay where was I so we decided
to write stuff down and um the first
thing we wrote down what Reed said to me
let's write a let's write down our
values let's have an offsite and do a
values exercise I'm like I'm not doing
that no I'm not I'm not if you want me
to create a poster or t-shirts we'll
just create some cool thing to put on
T-shirts but I will write down um
behaviors so instead of writing down
esoteric aspirational things we wanted
to be in right at this time remember we
started Netflix in 1998 it was during
the collapse of Enron I'm like you ever
seen their values boss you know they're
like carved in stone and they clearly
didn't follow them so we wrote down um
the things we value in each other one of
the first things we wrote down was
Intelligence because I said I said to
Reed I'm like how about if we just don't
hire any stupid people he goes can we
write that down I'm like we can just do
it can't we and he goes well why would
we say something like I'm like you're
totally
intolerant let's just be real and let's
just not hire some people that don't
challenge us right so if for those of
you who have read the Netflix culture
deck that's the first section of it and
we rewrote that section six times during
the 14 years I was there um so what we
did was we'd write something down and
we'd talk through it with our
organization and we would say okay are
we true to those things and let's let's
use those behaviors you know probably
once a month at our executive team we
would pick one of those behaviors
courage and say okay everybody come to
the meeting with an example of somebody
on your team who's demonstrated that and
then of course it would be well how
about these three people on your team
who didn't what are we going to do about
that right so that we wrote that um we
had a tough time in the company uh most
people don't know this either we were
going to go public in the year
2000 uh and the dot bubble burst in the
Silicon Valley that was when our DVD
mail by mail customers were really only
in the we'd like to say it was
us-wide uh and then all of a sudden our
customers were all out of work and um
and the economy went to hell and the
bankers pulled the IPO and we didn't
know if we were going to make it so I
laid off a third of the company it was
small company but you know 30% that's a
lot and we decided that we weren't going
to be Yahoo for movies and we weren't
going to be everything to everybody so I
had to get rid of the great team of
people who wrote um personal movie
reviews these guys were from like
variety and People magazine they were so
fun I love those guys still but you know
we we realized that well customers could
write reviews and that was free so we'll
let them do that so we we got rid of um
anybody who wasn't technically very
qualified anybody who wasn't working
directly on DVD by mail and anybody who
slipped in who was a baby or a whiner
because I couldn't listen to that guy
complain about the color of his T-shirt
anymore because he would not believe me
when I said you don't understand we
don't have money for
t-shirts um and actually I think that
that time for us was a a really
important time for Netflix that some of
you have yet to experience which is
poverty
drives really important decisions it
drives you to focus so that Christmas um
in
2001 uh uh in 200 DVD players dropped to
99 bucks and everybody in America got
one for Christmas and inside of every
box was a coupon that said try Netflix
for free and our business
went but we didn't couldn't hire more
people because our business was going up
for every new customer we had to buy
three DVDs at $20 a piece and the stamps
and the envelopes and the labor qu man
so we were doing twice as much work with
third as many people and it was more fun
I mean it was so exciting it was
palpable I mean people were just and I
also had gotten rid of all the middle
managers so I was said to read as we
were carpooling one day I'm like how fun
is this I mean this should be really
hard he goes I know go figure it
out and I realized that it was because
we were very clear about what we needed
to do an incredible Clarity everybody
shared every bit of information and
numbers that we had on our growing
trends of our business we had every
single person was in the right job for
what we're trying to do now and the
alternative to success was
death I mean really if we either made it
or it was over and people were so
engaged because everybody mattered every
single there was no fluff anywhere and
so that's when I wrote the chapter we
wrote together the chapter called high
performance for those of you who've left
seen the deck and after we did that we
said you know high performance people
are engaged all these all the things I
just told you and then we got lucky and
we went public and then I looked around
the company and went
 it's not the right set of people
cuz now we're a public
company right so I had whole departments
full full of hardworking sincere
fabulous early stage startup people and
those of you who've been in an early
stage startup here's how you solve
problems you work really hard you know
how do you solve this problem you just
pound at it you know how do you figure
out what the right answer is you do the
wrong answer 142 times right whiteboards
are filled with lists of not that not
that not that not that and then if you
have a chance for real success and
you're in the right time and you have
enough money your problems instantly
change from problems of difficulty to
problems of complexity and scale and
when I looked around the team I was like
oh
man you know this part of the business
is going to grow a hundred times next
year and I got a team of people that I
know can imagine 10 times but you really
can't imagine 100x unless you've seen 50
yeah and so we had to then work on what
was high performance performance right I
had to work with each part of the
business and say knowing what we need to
do in the next couple of years would you
have this team that you have now and
then there was a very large temptation
to go well you know you're really good
but I really need somebody who's twice
as good or twice as experienced but I
tell you what I'll give you half the job
and I'll give you half the job there
then you can stay and we get the whole
job done but you actually don't know
what you're doing so now I have to have
a supervisor who tells you what to do
the supervisor doesn't actually do
anything except tell you what to do and
since the supervisor's job is to tell
you what to do they have to have a
manager and the manager sets direction
for the supervisor to tell the person
what to do and then the manager is only
setting Direction doesn't really set
Direction so I have to have a director
to have the and all of a sudden it
occurred to me that's how org
charts look like those big fat pyramids
what if I just said I love you bunky and
then hire the right person so that buy
read Hastings right bony is whoever I
had you're my bunky right now Robert so
you be a bun so that was chapter so then
when I that part like high getting real
high performance people on the team uh
that took a couple of years yeah right
and then after that we're like okay if
we have high performing people on the
team who are fully formed adults for
whom judgment is the most important
thing to do and then we're big enough
that we're getting a lot of pressure as
a public company to start doing rules
and process we need a we need expense
report process we need a travel
reporting process and we need a vacation
policy so some of you might have heard
about that and then I stopped and went
why wh why they don't clock in and out
and I really only care about what they
deliver why do I need a vacation policy
oh my God the lawyers went
ballistic KPMG came down they had
audited us they're like you guys are
insane we do we use the firm ini it's a
big law firm in the Silicon Valley and
Larry sansini got on the phone with Reed
and I he said I want you to know that I
personally forbid you to do this and we
said thank you very much for your
counsil Larry and we did it
anyway be here's why I started to
calculate okay what what's the issue
what are people afraid of they're afraid
there's no law that in California that
says you have to have time off for
salaried employees so first I did my
homework right and then I knew that the
lawyers God bless them we going to be
concerned that we'd be sued because we
would apply the policy indiscriminately
somebody would get more vacation than
somebody else okay for those of you who
work at companies which I assume is all
of you don't some people take more time
off than
others anyway we call them
exceptions so rather than policing
exceptions I decided that if I just
focus on what people got got done I
really didn't care
so who has a no time off policy who's
adopted something like that um you know
what it turned out to be you know what
kind of time off people
take same as they used to people with
kids in school take school holidays and
a couple weeks in the summer and
something in the winter and uh young you
know single people they save it all up
and they hik Neal I'm a big fan of the
3-day week I mean the 3-day weekends
because I pretend I work full-time
um but what the difference was was that
people felt this
huge
power just by being in control of that
right and then I started realizing that
in order to manage that well I had to
help my managers be clear about what
they were trying to do what Their time
frames were so rather than having my
managers spend their time you know
coaching and developing everyone for
Success all of the time they needed to
spend their time saying here's our time
frame and then Robert goes yeah but I
wanted to hike Nepal and you're like
well you know we need to deliver this in
April so could you go in may let me
check the
weather right it's it's like I always
love things around maternity leave
that's a great I love I love that leave
it's the leave you have nine months to
plan right so so when I'm telling you is
so then we'd try something and when I
when I rolled out the the no vacation
plan I didn't say this is it we've made
up our minds you know I've been touched
and I know this to be true my vision I
said you know if it doesn't work out
we'll go back to doing what everybody
else does there's always that option
yeah you know best practices don't start
her don't start from Best Practices
you're only empowering her H I like the
way you come back after your rant to
answer the question thanks um
I'm already kidding really kid that was
lightning round wasn't it that wasn't
very lightening okay really joking
really joking thank you um the document
so just listening to Brian cold earlier
on we were talking about Brian when he
was speaking I talk about that
spirit in my mind this document captured
the spirit and the personality of
Netflix yeah with that in mind what role
did this document play when you went
through all of that change do you think
it was an integ part to the success of
the business yes I do but first of all
Hart
Brian I I I might take up herling
just to be around him Kenny will be
trilled to have you I'm sorry for he's a
great guy yeah I do I I think that what
first of all the other thing is I didn't
write it the management team didn't
write it we always whenever we would
roll out a new part of it we rolled it
out with the rest of the company you
know and employees would come to me and
they're like I you know I don't like
like what you guys said like at one
point in the compensation piece I
encourag people to interview it's like
you want to know what you're worth go
interview so one of my managers came in
she goes I don't think we're going to
get anything done now that you and Reed
told everybody they have to interview
I'm like oh for God's sake it's a
PowerPoint presentation you know it's
not an order from God and by the way I
walk through the building and people
seem to be working are you disagreeing
with the concept are you disagreeing
with how it's written she's like well I
just don't like how it's written I'm
like send me a rewrite I'll update it
it's not that hard right so people had
were involved in it and um and more
importantly and I think what you the
panel right before us just said that so
oh you guys said so much great stuff you
can see people doing it I love the
examples of a great culture is when it's
manifested in what people do every day
so absolutely it got us through tough
times um but the other thing that got us
through a lot of tough times was our um
um that was part of the culture was the
complete transparency about what was
happening in the business and our
assumption that the fully formed adults
who are really smart were really
interested in the business we used have
a meeting every Friday too talked about
the Friday meeting we called it the
metrics meeting and we'd all go out in
our parking lot and we'd pass around a
piece of paper and the paper was
basically the executive dashboard right
how much money you had in the bank how
much revenue there was what our cost of
goods were you know just basically the
operations of the business the basic p&l
and whatever was on our minds customer
sat and we go around the table and we
talk about just stand out in the parking
lot and talk about it and collectively
go you know how about it have we ever
tried this and somebody'd be like no
that's a good thing let's try that right
we learned later that from the exhe head
of
Blockbuster that they used to send spies
to hide in the bushes on Friday for our
metric
meeting isn't that great super yeah yeah
yeah the ultimate compliment I think you
mentioned culture yeah you've previously
described your role in effx as being the
chief operations officer of culture and
the product manager of people people
yeah what did you mean by that Patty I
meant by that was it was my job to make
sure for example that we had a very very
disciplined very very effective
recruiting team for example and what I
mean by disciplined was you and I have
talked about this because we do the same
thing in that way um that we had a
constant sense of what the available
Talent was for the company now and for
the future and that the the
identification of that Talent was not
the job of HR that was the job of
everybody in the company particularly in
management and so I say you know
Management's job is to build a great
team that builds high quality stuff on
time that's pretty much it right but you
have to put together the team and so we
had we did a lot of work around making
sure that pipeline was full making sure
that we knew what the next generation of
talent was um making sure that we were
partnering with the hiring managers not
delivering
to partnering not delivering to so
whenever I got a new manager who goes
well I can't you know I just I'm going
to have to tell Reed I can't get this
stuff done cuz HR isn't giving me enough
candidates I'm like wow you're going to
be in
trouble because he goes yeah cuz I heard
you gave my recruiter to somebody else
I'm like right because you don't return
our
calls CU you don't respond to emails
because you don't look at resumés so
clearly you have another methodology for
building a great team which is what
we're paying you to do by the
way it's not our job to run whatever it
is we hired you to do it's your job so
that's where that was my job to build
that my other job was to build a culture
of people who would call each other on
great Behavior or not great Behavior to
be able to say in a meeting wow you know
you we're almost done making this
decision and you've been complaining
about what a stupid idea you thought it
was for the last three months so did we
change your mind or or
what and then you to say actually no I
disagree and for to have a nice argument
about that and to walk away and you
live right that's that's what culture
really is during the same panel
discussion earlier that Brian was on Bob
Maru from Boston College mentioned about
trying to get people to work on I think
was to mirror some part of um the Middle
East from Sunday so outside of office
hours and again he was said look he
doesn't he wants people to buy into that
purpose how important is it from a
leader whether it be a h or leadership
perspective or business leader
perspective or the same thing which they
probably are to practice what they
preach it's everything and um the other
thing I heard on the panel here that
just warmed my heart
um one of the things I think that people
who are
in internal functions in companies do is
they refer to other people in the
company as their customers that's my
internal customer I'm a service
organization I used to tell my HR team
you know we're a service organization
it's not spelled s RV an
TS just FYI so when they start treating
you like that just walk away just walk
away walk away um the customer doesn't
work in your company
typically right the customer is someone
you serve with delight and one of the
beautiful things about Netflix that's
not true for everybody here but kind of
is we you know we were our own customer
so everybody had a legitimate reason to
comment on the product or service like
when I I remember when I first signed up
my dad he kept you know endlessly
clicking on stuff I'm like Dad we just
did it we sign it's like it says click
here it says click here so I'm doing a
bug report while my dad's doing it right
my Dad's getting an email to sign up for
the service the service should know he's
already signed up right so we could all
collectively but we but we all could
keep each other Real by saying okay and
you you want to have a 16 person sign
off for this particular thing how does
that make a customer
happy because 16 signups is going to
take what seven days yeah and aren't we
delivering something to the customer
that would make them happy like right
now darl spoke a lot about that from
intercom as well yes exactly right so
you know that
and and the idea that and here's another
HR word I hate I hate empowerment I hate
it I hate it I hate it um you're
empowered there you
better like we have these little wands
or something I always wanted a
wand people have power they walk in the
door with power we have to empower them
because we took it away so let's forget
that but
Sigmar the best money we ever SP let's
just just you know so what I what and
and the other thing that Brian said
today that I loved was if you expect
mediocrity from people that's exactly
what you're going to get if you expect
amazing you'll be surprised I mean I
loved how he talked about constantly you
know you can do better you can do more
you can do better you can do more and I
think if you remove obstacles so that
people can do that they'll do it right
right everybody loves that feeling yeah
you mentioned your dad I'll tell you a
quick story just before we Segway into
the world the future world of of of of
uh of talent um he heard you on George
hook on Monday I know many you heard
Patty George hook um and he text me he
goes very sweet he goes goes I know
you're going to the airport to pick up a
lady on Sunday in the airport you know
and he goes I heard on the radio I think
it was Patty I said yeah and he goes
yeah goes she's doing amazing work so we
have a new fan of my dad but then he
said to me he goes I thought it was just
um Dyson who are really that edgy what
do you mean go Neil Fisk are doing
amazing things I said know it's Netflix
it's Netflix it's Netflix you know so
you're building them by the minute by
the minute yeah Georg is
challenging he sure is so just moving on
to the Future world of work okay let's
touch on a couple of things that we
spoke the panel spoke about throughout
the day right yes um and I know you love
Brian we also said we're trying Patty's
writing a book we're trying to get a
chapter on Ireland in Patty's Book and
and I I think after today might be some
mention I hope but Michelle the great
diss Rob get her arrested we'll
definitely feature in the book
like the day is Young yet so the first
panel discussion this morning was about
diversity yeah yeah um piracy yeah what
are your
views it's now time for my call to
action on pay equality
absolutely well first of all I had this
aha the other day really pissed me
off where are the three what are the
three most female dominated departments
in our companies marketing finance and
HR could we please fix pay
inequality if we don't own this who the
hell does okay so it's easy you go back
and you make a list of all the titles in
your organization you can take one team
or another just fig figure it out put
the average male salary the average
female salary if there's a discrepancy
true it up write a check
done just fix it then go back and find
out how you got there then go find out
about inherent bias then go talk about
how we need to interview people make fix
all those things but first just fix it
so I ran diversity programs at Sun
Microsystems in 1989 and 90 and when
Cheryl Sanders book came out with the
data about how we were doing it was
worse okay because I think what we did
in the 90s was we we all had diversity
programs and we had coaches and I been
speaking circuit like this with the head
of diversity at Apple and head of
diversity at HP and we talked and we
talked and we talked and we
talked we talked and we talked so now
it's time for Action people okay so
that's it's dollars and cents to start
with it's filling the pipeline with a
diverse pool of candidates it's
insisting that your recruiters do that
too um go into your company take a pad
of paper that's why I tell people yellow
legal pad who's the best woman you've
ever worked with who's the best woman
you've ever worked with who's the best
woman you've ever worked interview them
all you will hire somebody it takes work
right so now is the time for us to get
the work second thing
if you're a woman or you're in a company
that hires women which I'm assuming is
all of
us and you bring someone into your
corporation who's paid less than what
they're worth in the open market say you
come in at 20% below what you're worth
with our compensation systems let's say
you have a performance review program
that's attached to your compensation
system with a 6 half% Merit increased
budget and Bill curve distribution
across your salary ranges that you you
that you do once a year and you're
amazing what are you going to get if
you're amazing you get 15% twice as much
as everybody
else you're behind by
five you'll never catch up so if we
don't threw it up we're just going to
keep doing it forever and ever two men I
told this to had these two reactions one
man said uh you know I'm a vice
president I'm very influential in my
company I'm very successful and the
reason why I'm successful is because I'm
very fiscally responsible I'm like
that's wonderful John and he said so if
you're telling me that I get a candidate
who's a woman who's making 130 and a man
who's making 150 that I should offer
them both 160 because it's
fair Botox
face he goes but that wouldn't be doing
the right thing for my company I I'm
like wow that is so
logical what are you going to tell your
daughter when she comes home and tells
you that story and he said oh it'll be
fixed by
then you're
laughing but you've seen somebody do
this right Second Story startup guy in
Texas I'm going through the same thing
with him and he goes well yeah like as
if I could do that I'm like not he goes
well you know like what he goes you you
know I'd get sued I'm like you're going
to get sued because you're going to give
a bunch of people in your company a
raise like you gave me a raise that's it
I'm finding a
lawyer he goes no no no it's not it it's
would be admitting that I'm wrong like
you are
wrong if you can admit it to me admit it
to them maybe might make you a happier
guy so I'm very passionate about this
because I I have 26-year-old twin
daughters I don't want them to do this
again we we got to stop doing this my my
two daughters are fixed for career
they're going to be hurlers they're
going to be the first International
hurlers in on thank you David the second
is panel discussion we looked at so we
spoke about employer branding yeah yes
we great insights from really really
exciting companies and then monster do
really of exciting stuff around Europe
and around the states what's your say
top tree tips for every the audience to
build a real meaningful employer
brand happy delighted enthusiastic
customers who will recommend you to
somebody else first and foremost it's
your product right so it's it's not your
video that's attached to your website of
your employees playing
foosball um or you know I I went to this
I'm so bad I went to a really cute
startup in Southern California and I'm
like razor scooters on your
website like you that's kind of So
Yesterday bartenders like Razor scooters
like a Nerf guns whoa old school um have
a great product first of all that
everybody talks about anyway because the
best employer brands are associated with
great products right oh wow you work at
Microsoft I use that wow Salesforce what
a great company that is right what
inroads they've made and the second is
if you're going to be declar narrative
about who you are as a company and what
you stand for then do that make sure
that your actions match it I I met um I
B met Blake MOSI who's the CEO of TOMS
and we were talking about employee
engagement stuff and I said to him um so
what do you do like what's your Perks at
Tom's he goes oh Patty I'm the biggest
tide wad on the planet he goes seriously
I don't buy them water I'm like wow the
guy on the other side he buys seven
kinds of water like he's you know still
and sparkling in four flavors um and he
said no I I only do one thing um I make
sure that each of my employees in their
first two years of employment goes to a
third world comp country and puts shoes
on the feet of a child it's like
done so the thing about employer
branding is it it's as unique as your
company and so which leads me to my rant
about best
practices um it's a thing that we say
that has literally no
meaning right best practices is either a
what everybody else does or B what the
cool company dour does right when we did
the no time off policy this is another
fun story every startup was doing it
right so then a friend of mine who's
doing HR at this startup in San
Francisco calls me up she goes Hey
listen oh she sends to the I have a
group I have have a HR posy of people
that we send each other emails
to um like has anybody tried to do a
bonus plan to get people to take
vacation because nobody's actually
taking vacation I was thinking like has
anybody are you doing cash bonuses or
Equity I'm like will you go call your
grandmother and say
that just maybe you need to give them
really tight vacation policy so that
then they can be free of it right it's
and then I met her with her CEO and I
said Do you ever take vacation he goes
oh God no he goes yeah I'm taking one
but I'm not telling anybody I'm like
could you please bring back
pictures because if you never take
vacation it doesn't matter what you
write down it matters what you
do I think it's Echo your sense of best
practice just reminded me of Brian's
discussion about Excellence yeah but
there's no end so future practice
continuous Improvement always moving and
developing and developing developing
chapter in your book um the next panel
we had so we John um Staffing industry
analy talking about the future world at
work so different Generations that
working different ways of working and
insourcing Outsourcing Robotics and so
on which thought was quite good and
David from recruitment International
mentioned and he said he mentioned the
survey the first question of the survey
about Millennials said that the
Millennials hate being called
Millennials yeah so the generational
divide um how do you see that moving and
developing and what can we do or should
we do anything at all you know we'll
give up this Millennial crap when they
turn 30 so right then we'll have to
think of some like they're X's or yers
or zers or I hate the millennial you
were a millennial I was a millennial
we're not anymore or maybe you are but
you know one of these days you won't be
it's called being young in the workforce
right and you know the same stereotypes
happen the other way around with the you
know the Boomers or whoever whatever
label we call call each
other instead of trying to understand
the difference between people who grew
up with a computer in their hand versus
those of us who didn't see it until we
were at work that's a pretty important
thing to think about but we're all just
people right so if we think of each
other as in some spectrum of our careers
and we start thinking about the teams
that we build and how people come
together to create great products or
services for our customers then we're
going to be really glad we have lots of
different kinds of people right I I mean
not like at Netflix I told the story
yesterday I was always the one that
represented like the normal shopping
person because everybody on this
particular team was a bunch of Engineers
and they would AB test everything to
death I'm like you don't have to AB test
that I'll tell you what a normal person
would do cuz you guys do you know what
do you mean don't you think they want to
don't you think they want a monitor on
their screen that shows their internet
bandwidth capacity as it's going I'm
like no the internet's
magic that's how we think of it those of
us who are normal okay no we don't no we
don't need to know CPU capacity we don't
really need to know that so I mean I
think that the more that
people that have wisdom and have
experience believe it's part of their
job to make sure they pass that along
and then learn and be curious about
things that they don't know I mean those
are great behaviors to have in
organizations and we'll make her us
better organizations and we'll make us
reflective of the world we live in I I I
coach a CEO at this wonderful company in
India it's called hike messenger and
it's like Snapchat but they use emojis
and the Emojis are all very Indian you
know she has her veil on she has her
veil off it's just so cute um but their
biggest the last time I talked to him I
said wow I heard you guys grew like 300%
last quarter I mean rock on and um and
your biggest growth segment was 18 to 24
year old women he goes yeah I know it's
really exciting isn't it we're doing a
lot of testing I'm like how about if you
test by having 18 to you know having
young women on your team you have any
women on the on the engineering team
he's like no you know Patty I haven't
thought of that and I'm like trust me
you don't know what an 18-year-old woman
wants
ever very interesting I must work on
that leadership
skill talking about female Business
Leaders so female Business Leaders so
the next stream then so just to Segway
into the following stream so one on
leadership and values based leadership
um and Michael from Trinity mentioned
about that impact on community but
walking the walk yeah yeah
um what's your sense of the impact say
the HR leaders in the
room yeah uh and the Business Leaders in
the room what can we do
tomorrow to build capacity to create
more jobs which is what this week is
about well you started the question with
female leadership and honestly I think
all of us just if the more we can come
to the middle the better we are again
it's more about understanding the what
we have in common MH let me start with a
a context thing sure you know when
you're talking to somebody and you look
at them and the bubble over their head
is like they have no clue this person is
totally
clueless close your eyes count to 10
look at them again and say this person
doesn't have a clue they don't know they
don't know what I know right so then
it's your job then to instead of you
know be smug and walk away and go
there's another person that doesn't know
what they're talking about to instead
invest the time and say do you
understand where I'm help me understand
where you're coming from right so the
more we're curious about each other the
more we know and that's a male and
female thing um I tend to think that
women are better at it sometimes than
men unless they're challenging a
position of authority and then they
don't do anything but that's another
whole
conversation um and I think that
successful companies create jobs right
so and if we you know if you put
together everything I've said which is
you want your companies to reflect the
goodness of your product or service and
in order to do that your product or your
company should reflect the people that
you serve which will help with
and that will help create more jobs
right you're going to want I I just I
believe in capitalism I believe in that
it's not a trickle down Theory it's a
trickle out Theory and the more
successful we all are the more people we
need to help our businesses grow Adriana
hington hington adri oh you want me to
adri impression so I'm on this group I
have no clue how I got invited honestly
I don't but it's um a virgin unite
virgin unite is the philanthropic uh arm
of Virgin and Richard Branson Ariana
Huffington got together and they have
this group of people that meet twice a
year um to talk about 100% human at work
and they always develop whenever we get
together there's a really glossy
brochure attached they're really good at
Graphics so look for it and maybe you
know they'll send you one and you'll
think wow I'm really cool because I got
this glossy magazine so Ariana's big
thing is about about uh rest and
relaxation she's a big fan of napping
Pods at work um and that people because
she was a workaholic and then she
collapsed because of overwork so now
she's on this big mission to change that
so Ariana is doing this talk I'm doing
my Arana she goes you know at the huff
post we have a policy do not work on the
weekend it's time to rest and relax
recharge yourself so Sunday I was
shooting off some emails and do you know
that people in the hu post responded in
five minutes what's with that I mean I
know I sound like the Saturday Night
Live impression but she is exactly like
that she sounds exactly like that so she
gets done with her speech and she walks
away and I didn't get a chance to talk
to her so I sent her an email you know
and the the subject line is tough love
you know dear Ariana um you know you are
our Arana Huffington one you are any
Huffington and I'm thinking that pretty
much anybody on the planet who gets an
email from you on Sunday is going to
reply call me crazy right
two if why are you why do you have a
policy about when people can sell send
emails don't you have adults working for
you can't they figure out when to send
email and three you know it's not what
you say is what you do and you and I
have had this conversation a number of
times boom reply it's Sunday by the
way daddy darling I have to respond
reading in my accent you're so funny and
adorable you're crazy
too here at the hu post our policies are
merely
suggestions very good very good I won't
to ask you about the AR jackon I I
threatened it I can't do my this is as
far as I've gotone on my Irish accent
m
good enough good enough good enough good
enough you know your last name it's
McDougall I
don't I am now though I do have a new
hero um I got to remember it gracei
what what do you call her in yeah the
the pirate Queen hell
yeah she's my girl what's the Irish name
I'm supposed to call her gr gr
granu yeah baby she says to the English
Queen iin bound I'm a queen
too okay I'll the Spanish fine you guys
are cool she's in the book she's in the
book she's in the book you've been
accredited with Reinventing
HR yeah what do you think the most
impactful changes that you influenced or
brought about or did in Netflix for
example and what's next I looked at
every single thing we did in traditional
HR and ask
myself
why why do we do the annual performance
review what's the point the point is to
give people feedback okay if I was an
inventor and I was like all the
inventors that I worked with I was
surrounded with at Netflix and I said
okay you know what I want to do I want
to create a system that gives people
feedback on their performance because I
believe that it might make for better
performance
I agree would you come up with the
annual performance
reval I mean it's a terrible system to
give feedback right have I already said
my thing about Scotty no I was on stage
in Montreal with the um the former head
coach of the National Hockey League in
Montreal in the hockey Stadium I mean
this guy came up on stage and people
were weeping right oh my God Scotty
Bowman they're like taking selfies I
walk up on stage they're
like says how do you give feedback to
people on your team Scotty goes you know
we have an 80 Game season every 10 games
we get together um we put together the
stats on that player I get feedback from
the other coaches I write down some
feedback the player comes in they have
feedback on themselves we have a
discussion we figure out what we're
going to do for the next 10 games so
then the moderator says to me hey Patty
how do you feel about feedback like what
he
said so that you know that's if you look
at everything we do with an innovator
and inventor's mindset then two things
are going to happen one of them is
you're going to have to have Clarity on
what the results are that you want to
achieve by whatever it is you're doing
just like everybody else in the business
does by the
way and you'll also realize that some of
the most innovative work you can do in
HR is to stop doing stuff that doesn't
matter like what the annual performance
review like the seven levels of approval
like the going to somebody in an
accounts payable clerk in finance to
approve
$5,000 that she has no clue what it's
going to be spent on like the and and
then but then let's take that one let's
take um let's take
expenses so uh when I got rid of expense
approvals and expense limits I had to
talk my CFO into turning the people in
finance who were the people that were
approving expense reports to people who
were reporting back to the organization
on a pretty regular basis so managers
all got uh reports of all the
expenditures of everybody in their com
everybody in their Department monthly
and and then we encouraged them to say
wow that you went out with a couple of
colleagues on Friday and you guys spent
$700 for dinner and for the four of
you what's up right oh you know Robert
likes that $200 bottle wine we drank
four bottles I don't know it's like what
were you doing there oh we were having a
work meeting
really that's why God made the
conference rooms over here right and you
I did this with my head of recruitment
she's like are you going to fire me I'm
like no you're going just use good
judgment next time I don't care if you
buy a canidate $200 B bottle of wine but
that's why I pay him a fortune that's
why he drinks $200 wine um but but those
would drive the conversations around was
money wisely spent which is the real
conversation you want to have and and
you would be surprised what you uncover
you know I said to the I'm walking
through the um engineering part of the
building right when we were were
starting to like your remote control we
were uh streaming to TV sets and this
one part of the building every single
engineer had two 50-in flat screen TVs
in their cubicles I'm like holy
look at this is a lot of money somebody
else goes yeah you know we buy them at
Best Buy so I find that and I'm like how
much money are you spending on TVs and
how come you're buying them at Best Buy
and can't Sony send them to us directly
I mean I'm thinking we have
relationships with these suppliers and
he goes yeah they can but that's not
where our customers get them Patty
our customers get them at Best Buy this
is this is the test organization and uh
you should be aware that we need to talk
about facilities because their next
version is 70
in which makes complete sense you know
was it a fortune in television yes would
that have gotten approved there no
way right and and then we had the real
conversation which is yeah you know
actually I'm spending a lot of money and
TVs and since you give me a holistic
budget I'm a little worried about my
headcount cuz you know I at the point
where the 70inch flat screen TVs might
add up to another engineer and we need
to talk and then we did right then we
would come back and say looks like a a
bump in in costs in this department how
are we going to move that across teams
instead of you know how am I going to go
beg readed to give me more money he
might say I did some horse trading with
lesli and
marketing so that's a different yeah
yeah yeah makes sense going come to you
for questions in a second H but before I
do py could you give us your top three
takeaways or tips given the theme of
building a culture with purpose yeah to
everyone in the room please clarity
about your purpose is number
one
um and it's whatever you write down
whatever it is you agree
upon be careful about the words and make
sure everybody can say them the
same you know I used to
say okay we should count on one hand the
things that are important to us this
year and I should be able to go to
anybody in the company and say what five
things are important for us to
accomplish this year and I better get at
least four
right so that people can come in in the
morning I I used to say you know what
you want to say to yourself every day is
what do I do today that moves as
farthest
fastest and when you go okay well this
thing that I want to do that's kind of
fun isn't on that list you know maybe I
can Lobby for it next year so one is
Clarity of your purpose the second one
is um and the team here before me talked
a little bit about it and I Lov that
everybody talked about celebrating
Milestones I mean and celebrating little
wins and celebrating big wins you know
don't let those things go by without
marking them and I guess the third thing
is
to spend the time the team before has
talked a little bit about reflection but
I I want to talk about it a little
differently use your mistakes to make
you
stronger you know so for every time
someone stands up on stage and
celebrates a big win try and find
somebody who will stand on stage and say
you know I was
wrong you know I made that decision and
I powered through it and it turned out
to be a bad idea and here's the
information that I had at the time and
here's why I made the decision and
here's what I've learned to be true
since I made that decision and the more
you're leaders can model um you know
reflection and correction then I think
that gives people a sense of purpose
especially if that leader says I drove
this decision hard because I thought we
were attacking this problem and I was
wrong so I'm going to need your help in
helping me think because we still going
to have tack that problem or hey by the
way the five things we thought were
important one of them turned out not to
be right the the other thing we do as
leaders we commit to Direction and then
we're like well got to do that come hell
or high water even if it turns out to be
wrong so allow yourself to correct
midcycle I think brilliant py can I just
conclude um just spending three days
with you has been phenomenal been fun
it's been great fun um and so many
lessons and so many takeaways and just
my experience of you to just trick key
takeaways and they're changing every day
so I summarize like a j Springer moment
summarizing the the session take you're
going to have nine key takeaways when
we're done CU you have three every day
of the still I'm trying to keep it
simple so of three right so one treat
people like people yep it's a
reoccurring theme in everything you're
saying two is use good judgment I know
you worked with hub spot was well
articulated in their document when you
make a decision how does it impact one
your customer two the company Tre you
and that hierarchy of decision making
and using judgment I thought was quite
powerful um and then a good dose of
Common Sense yeah my mama calls it Horse
Sense hor sense yeah you just got to
have Horse Sense she's from Texas so she
says things like that very good well
look it's been a pleasure to spend time
with you we're so happy to have you here
we would love you to come back to
Ireland sometime um if not we'll read
about in the book but uh thanks so much
for joining us pleas than you I love
Ireland thank
you

oh thank you ian thanks for having me so
much has changed uh although you know we
we started out by by pointing out the
fact that we do have a
doodle from the last time you were here
and you taught us all kinds of things
about the difference between
you know being part of a family and part
of a team we've just been through
and not through we're in the middle of a
pandemic uh
what's what have you been thinking about
what has changed in your world
around you know the future of work well
you know when i travel around the world
and i
talk about changing things and throwing
things away and trying things
differently and
innovating um after i speak i always go
out in the audience and someone will say
well that's all sounds really great but
i can't you know i can my
company's too bureaucratic we can't try
new things we're second to my cfo
what my ceo won't i don't have a city at
the table
um i can't i can't i can't and then all
of a sudden you know we can't work from
home right we can't work remotely and
then
boom like you sure can
right and what i'm really finding out as
i'm talking to people
is i'm really trying to emphasize that
people
know that this is a muscle that we
always had we just never used
and remember this moment when when
first of all nothing's going to ever go
back to normal but let's say we're
past this and on the other side when
people say we should try something
different
remember that you can interesting you
should say that patty i
i think that um you know one of the
things that has changed so much
is uh is this notion that
you know proximity is now optional and i
wonder
you know i mean if all of a sudden you
know we can hire people sort of anywhere
they don't need to move because we know
how to work virtually
now it would be nice to get to some sort
of hybrid where we actually could see
people on an ongoing basis but
how do you think this is going to affect
the way that uh you know people do
firm formation and and access global
talent and
and where they live i don't know but but
we're finding out right i mean uh
i'm here in the bay area and
most people most companies that i know
were set up to do remote work anyway
they just never thought everybody would
be doing it
and you know back when you and i talked
i was talking about it's a team not a
family
and i think it's really interesting now
watching the families
in the middle of you know my my son is
working from home with my
nine-month-old granddaughter and um they
insist that she'd be part of every
meeting now
but then they wanted to go away and it's
really hard to manage
you know he told he tells me he's like
i'm just exhausted
it's just all the time all the time i
wish i i kind of miss
being in my car by myself commuting
because
it's the one time somebody doesn't need
me so i think we're learning a lot of
different things uh
you know i was thinking back the other
day to um
remember when the sort of thing du jour
was to figure out how to do meetings
and who should be at meetings and what
agendas should look like and how people
should participate
blah blah all these books are written
about it and now i'm thinking
well the idea of making meetings virtual
on zoom
may or may not be a good idea you know
some people say
i if i do another zoom call i swear to
god you know it's just too many
faces i can't do it and then i had
another i talked to another ceo
last week who said to me you know i do
my quarterly meetings now on zoom
and he said i literally see everybody in
the company
instead of in front of me on stage and
he said so
when i did the q a the other day this
person asked this really quick
great question and i didn't know them
and i said who isn't
some junior he's like i felt like i
really was in touch with everybody in my
company for the first time
so it's a lot of changes all the time
i'm recommending to people that you
that you journal it you know you write
down every day
something that you learned or something
that didn't go well or something that
did go well
and just constantly regurgitate that
stuff all the time because
we'll get it we'll get better like we do
with everything else
well it's interesting i mean early on we
went home i think on march the 12th or
something
um and it was one of the things that
struck me was that
um you know there's a there's a
a loss of intimacy but then there's an
additional
different kind of intimacy in the
relationships you mentioned your son
uh and uh and grandchild um
you know now we we we know uh the
children children's names of people who
are on our team we
we we see inside their homes there's a
is almost a heightened level of intimacy
or a very different
dimension of intimacy before we would
often you know keep our faces in a jar
by the door
and and that's gone yeah yeah and that
but and the whole idea of that the you
become an employee when you walk in the
door
there aren't any doors anymore
so i mean you know how i think those
relationships are really going to be
examined and and i think this um
we've been working virtually and
globally for a long time
i mean that's that's nothing new uh the
idea that we can do it as a matter of
course that's what's new
i mean ask anybody who has a global
workforce somebody's
up in the middle of the night it's i
know that when i do work with india
it's always very difficult because for
one of us it's 11 30 at night
it just has to be that's how you do it
so
i i think we're learning a lot about
that the other thing is
um i think we're we're starting to pay
better attention to deliverables and
you know parsing work out in chunks that
we can measure
partly because we can't see into the
future very well
and i think that's really helping people
tighten up the way they manage
the other thing that i'm really you know
swells my heart is that
okay these guys are adults they're gonna
do work without you paying attention to
them you don't
have to drop by and see that they're at
their desk fully formed
well-functioning adults or something
like that isn't that
what you like to talk about yeah it's
exactly what i like to talk about and
you know this we can't we can't we can't
my people won't
your people are certainly doing it right
now and people that are working are
pretty happy to be working
yeah we we have something called radical
transparency at communitech where we
make everything available to everyone
and
and and i think it's just about you know
trust you you just
trust it um i mean it was in the 90s i
was working for a big global company and
uh
you know of the 150 people who worked
for me two sat in the same office as me
and the rest were scattered around the
globe and so you know it is
you know the difference as you say now
is that this is at scale
um i guess one of the things that people
are are challenged with
right now is is how do you retain
culture
at a time like this because you don't
have the
you know everything is a meeting with an
agenda and then you get off the damn
thing as quickly as possible
um but you don't have the sort of
that other dimension of uh of of social
and so
people have tried things like you know
um uh
trivia games and you know beers on on
fridays and
uh all kinds of different ways and
keeping people connected but i know that
a lot of people
i just had my ceo roundtable at
peer-to-peer group
last week a lot of people are talking
about how do we how do we retain the
culture that we built
um and you know what would be some tips
and tricks is that we can that we could
put to work
i think we just got to pay attention to
it it has to be on our agenda
like everything else is um have i told
you my scott bowman story
so you know who scott bowman is right
maddie bowman yep scotty bowman so
i did a talk in montreal a couple of
years ago
and it was in february and my
i called my daughter i'm like hey i'm
doing this thing in february she says
mom go to patagonia get a puffy coat get
the big one
i had no idea any place on earth got
that cold
so i um i stayed at a hotel where i
could go underground to
the venue where i was speaking in that
venue was the bell center
i have no idea what this is right i'm
not i'm an american
i live in a coastal town i don't know
nothing about hockey
and i go underground and i'm in the
green room and scottie bowman's there
and we meet and he's a lovely
70 year old man in a rumpled suit with a
you know maple leaf pin an american flag
pin
and he says to me you know patty we're
under the ice
and it had never occurred to me that we
were in a hockey stadium i mean never so
i go up on stage
they introduce me and my face is on the
jumbotron
it was like oh my god
but i i have botox face so i maintain
you know i'm hr right
so i go sit down and everybody claps
politely scottie bowman comes on stage
and you can imagine
i'm at the bell center in montreal with
scott bowman the crowd
goes bananas right if they had foam
fingers they'd be waving them um
and people are stomping and taking
selfies and
you're canadian you understand all this
i don't understand this
so he sits down next to me on the little
sofa and
the moderator says mr bowman you've
coached so many of the greats you've won
so many tournaments you know
i we just re such admirers of your work
how is it that you coach your teams to
such greatness
how do you give them feedback and he
said well we play an 80 game
season and every 10 games i sit down
with each player they do an evaluation
i do an evaluation we talk about the
other team members
we talk about who we're going to play in
the next 10 games what we've done well
what's working well and then we put
together a plan
you know a performance improvement plan
so that the team can improve and
continue to
to succeed and the moderator says to me
patty mccord
it said that you hate the annual
performance review and you know that i
do
he said what would you do instead and i
said what he said
so i think it's that we have to make a
plan
and we have to literally put it on our
calendars to reach out to people
i mean i talked to i told you about my
friend ted she said that her team
they have a meeting on they have coffee
on friday mornings and they just go
around and go
how you doing you know that stuff that
you would do if i ran
into you at the coffee machine and
that's the stuff that we now have to
kind of schedule
and plan so that we just stay in touch
with each other
well it certainly is a new um
it's a new dimension to not just uh
uh how do we manage people but even
things like onboarding people and
orienting them uh in the midst of all
this and at a distance
it's it's remarkable though how uh we
have
learned about uh this uh pandemic and
and how we've adapted and we've gotten
pretty good at a lot of different things
what's the one thing that's kind of
surprised you
uh about this that you didn't expect
that you didn't see
coming whether it's sort of the response
of
of humanity or whether it's the way that
organizations are
thinking differently oh i think we can't
separate the pandemic from all the other
social things that are happening in the
world right now i mean
it's almost overwhelming you know i'm
i'm trying to figure out if i can
actually
take a non-social media day off
because it's just so i think that we
can't separate
what's happening in our corporations
from what's happening in society from
what's happening
with employment itself i mean
my daughter is works at a bakery she's
an essential worker
and we're now on our eighth day from her
getting tested
eight days i live in california and
she's going to work every day right
um so we there's just those kinds of
things
you know we just didn't deal with in
public with each other
anymore i want to separately make a note
about onboarding
so in the introduction you introduced me
as the writer of the netflix
culture deck and that's not true how we
wrote the culture deck
was it took 10 years
to write it and we wrote it
collaboratively so rita and i read
hastings who's the ceo of netflix and i
would brainstorm
uh you know let's talk about the
behaviors that we value and let's write
stuff down that was our big deal that we
were going to do differently at netflix
because we would work together at
another company so we wrote stuff down
so we wrote uh we'd write the chapter on
the things that we value and we discuss
it with the rest of our executive team
and then we talk about it with our
leadership team and then we talk about
it with the rest of the company
and because it was powerpoint we could
edit it
so we rewrote the first chapter about
things that we value
six times when i was there right so if
you go back
and look at it again every chapter is
written um the chapter before it
you mentioned fully formed adults right
adults that are mature
it we could not have freedom and
responsibility unless we had high
performing adults in the company right
so it took that part having high
performing employees
for me as the head of talent took me
four
years to figure out right i had to be
able to figure out a severance program i
had to have a killer recruiting team
i had you know i i had to have managers
who could set goals that were
achievable and could communicate them i
had to get myself out of the process of
figuring out great teams i had to start
talking about great teams
the reason i'm telling you this story is
that that was our onboarding document
that's why we wrote the netflix culture
deck and then one day the true story
one day reid picks me up because we
carpooled together
and he said we're driving along and he
says you know i met this woman at this
dinner last night who has this really
cool company they're putting
powerpoint slides online it's called uh
slideshare and i said oh man that's a
great idea i wish i had thought about
that i wonder what people are gonna put
out there and he said oh i put the deck
out this morning
and i said what oh no
why did you do that and he said well
what's wrong with it i said oh read it's
the ugliest document known to humankind
i mean it's just
i don't even think the fonts are the
same chapter and a chapter and he said
well you never told me it was ugly i'm
like well you know you are the ceo right
so and i said secondly you're going to
scare away all of our candidates
and he said only the ones we don't want
and it changed the way we interview the
next day because
the next day instead of me finding out
did you have the skills and you know do
you have all the acronyms on your resume
that match my job description now we're
talking about how do you like to work
how much direction do you want to need
right
how confident are you that you can do a
good job without worrying about security
all the time right so
um that's i i don't think that everybody
needs to write a culture deck
but the more information that people can
have particularly when you're on
boarding and hiring people
that they can access and start that
conversation
i think that's a really important way to
think about
because we can't we can find out so much
information about other companies but
but purposefully doing it is a really
important thing i think
well it's a it's interesting um you know
i think that
uh um how this is going to affect us in
the long term
um around uh how we work and where we
live
i do know uh i was doing an interview
with someone else and they were on the
33rd floor in a 400 square foot
apartment in downtown toronto
um and i'm you know cruelly sending them
listings of uh of backyards in waterloo
region
um but you do you think do you think
we're actually gonna get to a point this
time where
um we are going to have
the trust necessary that the people will
will actually get that point of
having the option of working virtually
i think it's going to depend on your
company
and your product and your
inherited culture
right it's it's gonna depend on who's in
charge
if you're in a company that's doing what
it's done the way it's always done it
and everybody in charge for the top
three levels
is a 60 year old white man
who's pretty used to doing things the
way they do them i think it's going to
be very difficult to change
but i also think like my story of the
ceo who
got the great question from the junior
person i think we're going to see
people participating that we didn't see
through the hierarchy before
i mean i think it's a great sort of
equalizer
the way we're working now so
you know it's your your conversation
also about cities versus
uh suburbs versus countryside i mean
that that will be an interesting one too
because
there's a reason people live in cities
because they're vibrant and they're
happening and
there's so much going on and there's not
so it will be
fascinating won't it i'm uh i'm actually
doing a talk
this week with um with matt mulleweg who
uh has the company that works completely
virtually and always has
and so it'll be really interesting to
learn from him if things changed
so you mentioned the fact that there's
lots of things that are happening
and um and it's not just about the
pandemic
do you think that this is finally the
wake-up call that
that we needed to address some of the
critical issues that we've been
dealing with for i mean i'm 60 years old
and i
and i i i think back you know
50 years and i would have just just
assumed that
many of these issues would not be things
we dealing with today
i'm i'm thrilled about it i think it's
really really hard work
i was i have been pretty frustrated for
the last couple of years
going to places where dni has become
dni and b and d and i and a and i mean i
i'm like why do we have to call it dni
it sounds like linens and things
why do we always turn everything into a
catchphrase right
so diversity is a really important thing
right we need to have
lots of different representation in our
organization so that we can respond to
our customers who are very diverse
particularly in america right
so um but the hard work is not
just that the hard work is listening to
each other
and making sure everybody gets the same
opportunity and
you know when the metoo movement was
happening i remember i got a call from
it was the week that three men in media
had gotten fired and three women took
their place and this was like
usa today or somebody called me and they
said what do you think about that and i
said
you know here in the silicon valley
people say we'd have more women in
leadership we'd have more
women on the board but it's a pipeline
issue right there's just not enough
qualified
women right i'm like look at look at um
matt lauer
no hoda was sitting next to him
it wasn't that hard oh where will we
find someone like these
the people are in front of you
it's not a pipeline issue you have any
women working at your company
hello
so i mean i think that i think it's a
really
really great opportunity for us
yes i i do too and i think that um
you know we all need to get better we've
got a plan at communitech we're going to
focus on how do we get better as a
as individuals and dealing with you know
sort of unlearning a lot of the
subconscious bias we're going to focus
on our own organization making sure
there's no systemic
uh discrimination bills to be built into
any of our
hiring process we're going to look at
our programs and how we support
underrepresented groups
and then we're going to work on helping
to coach our ceo
yeah and you know what there is you just
you just can't help it i mean i i
say uh when i when i go and talk about
like hiring or recruiting right i say
look here's
here's how job descriptions are written
they either describe
somebody who left that you wish hadn't a
fantasy person that doesn't exist
or whatever it takes to get it approved
okay so that's the baseline
and then when you talk to a hiring
manager about who we should hire
that hiring manager says you know i'm
looking for somebody who's
really smart quick on their feet able to
make good decisions
great with customers a good communicator
someone
just like me maybe younger
and like hires like hires like hires
like cars like i mean it is just
human nature and we went through this
whole thing out here where you know
culture meant hire somebody you want to
have a beer with i'm like
look no
there's i've hired data scientists all
my life you know
i'm not sure these guys drink beer
but i want them so
so you know in a way culture is a bit of
a bias
yes right but so maybe maybe the point
is
you know are all bias is bad i guess
well some are i mean you know the bad
ones
should you i i think it's more about um
you know for me as a former executive
right i have always been in the room
when somebody gets hired and somebody
gets promoted always for
you know years and years and years and
years and years and i know
that at the top in particular it's
familiarity
oh yeah i was in a meeting with him
and he's so articulate absolutely would
be a great vp
someday and if no one ever says
i was in the room with her right
then they don't get promoted that's
that's just how it works so i mean
that's the systemic
biases that i think are in every
organization which is who's in the room
who's not in the room what really
happens outside of it
i mean to focus on this conversation
won't it be interesting how those
conversations go
in the future when being in the
room is virtual
right i mean i remember i remember
somebody one time at our company who was
so old man he was the best presenter on
earth
he always had jokes and you know
interaction with the audience and it was
really great and i i was standing in a
meeting one time and talking to somebody
like they're like
isn't he great i mean he's just
incredible i'm like yeah see the numbers
they've been the same the last three
quarters
the presentations get better every
quarter the work's not happening
so it'll be interesting to see how we
actually start
measuring what's happening now but back
to my
incremental metrics as we move along
so you know throughout your career you
have uh
you've really stood hr in its head and
you've challenged a lot of the
assumptions whether it's
you know performance appraisals or you
know
uh how we hire recruits and motivate
people
um talk to me a bit about this you know
this distinction between
the issue you have around the word
empowerment
oh i just i think that the reason why we
have to uh
call it that and do it now is because we
took it all away from everybody
and i think people i i used to say
people walk in the door with power
but now they just wake up and get in
front of their computer and their
jammies with power so
um i just don't think it's something we
have to give to people i think we have
it's something that we have to give back
to people
you know since i've left netflix i've
tried to and i
and since i've been talking to a lot of
hr people now
i'm trying to find a different word for
it because human resources
is just outdated doesn't work so if i
look back to my time at netflix i would
say
i now say i was the ceo of the culture
the chief operating officer of the
culture so if i said
yes i believe we have uh adults with
good judgment
and i want them to operate with freedom
and responsibility then do i need a
time-off policy
do i need a travel policy do i need
a finance to approve every 10 000
of expenditure for somebody who has a
phd in math and knows what greater than
10 000 is
right or i would say
sometimes i would say or i was the chief
product officer for people and so i
would say
if i want to create a feedback mechanism
because my theory is
that feedback enhances people's
performance
so you know it's a hypothetical and i
wanted to create a product to do that
you'd never create the annual
performance review
you're going to give somebody feedback
once a year in arrears
and then you're going to use that to
figure out what to pay them in the
future
you know it's it's crazy and so that's
where
you it wasn't that i had all these crazy
wild ideas and i did all this
incredible invention it was mostly that
i just stopped doing stuff that didn't
matter anymore compensation i mean we
could do
an hour on compensation i just did a
last
year in new york i did a conference with
like a thousand compensation people
a thousand right i walk up on stage i'm
like the door is closed
it's just us i'm one of you please fix
equal pay go write some checks
who who are you waiting for permission
from
your compensation it is not brain
surgery
if the average male salary is higher
than the average female salary per job
title
fix it then go back home
and ask yourself what it is that you're
doing that got us here
because the math doesn't work right if
i'm a high performing person
the only way i'm going to get paid what
i'm worth is to leave
if the market for my skills goes up then
i if i'm stuck in a six and a half
percent merit increase budget
and i'm worth 20 more
you know you're trapped uh so it was and
so this is the part where i'm saying
just think about what all those
processes
all of those guidelines all of those
procedures all those
best practices
there's a word that you love well
i you know i'm out here where there's
always the company du jour
you know i mean half of the whole uh
gotta have a foosball table in every
office and a bartender on staff
that's all google stuff because they
were the cool company
so you know we copy each other a lot
so that's what i'm saying i mean i think
that maybe what can come out of this
is truly a customized uh
version story about your company and
your company culture
so that as people move through their
careers which they will
you know canada was it maybe it was with
you i did the
thousand ceos in the room and i said um
raise your hand if you're in the same
job you had when you left university and
of course
no hands went up and i said raise your
hand if the number
one metric that you have for human
resources is
retention 999 hands when i'm like
doesn't seem to you so
you know their mobility might not
not just be where you live it might be
changing your careers
you you talk about uh the distinction i
mean so much of what you say is common
sense and
and when you're done saying it of course
we're all nodding going she's absolutely
right you know
like we just we just got to use our
heads and be
you know grown-up adults but uh tell me
about the difference between you make a
distinction between uh
between team and family just unpack that
a bit for me
i'll go back to my scotty bowman story
you know teams come together to win for
the customer
that's it it's not that hard right i
used to tell my
hr team yes we're a service organization
it's not spelled s-e-r-v-a-n-t-s
and the people we serve don't work here
the people we serve
are watching tv
and so we got to make sure that we give
the organization the ability to put
together
fabulous teams of people that create
amazing product
that people will keep subscribing to
month after month year after year
that's and we got to get out of the way
of them doing that great work
that's what we do right we're not
somebody's mom or sister or
whatever it is so
it's you know it's about
i forgot the question
[Laughter]
family versus teams oh family versus
team so you know
it family's undying love you're gonna
loan your brother-in-law money and he's
never going to pay you back and you're
going to do it so your sister won't be
mad right don't do that at work that's
dumb
and you know you don't get to pick your
family but you do get to pick your team
and you get here's another story
i'm at a dni conference it's very
sensitive and um the coach of the
san antonio spurs is on stage and
somebody in the audience says oh you
know
you spend your whole year you know
playing
finding the best talent in the whole
country and putting them in the right
places and
winning so many games and they create
the spirit
and this this sense of togetherness and
at the end of the year at the end of the
season they could be cut from the team
doesn't that just break your heart and
he goes
no it's professional basketball
they know and they get to say they
played for the spurs
right and they'll have that for the rest
of their lives and i'm in the audience
going
how come we can do this with 26 year old
guys and we can't do that with a
you know an adult at work i think your
season's over dude
where should you play next
so patty you uh you spent a lot of time
hanging around with reed
hastings um what's he like
oh he's different all the time he's uh
you know they just announced last week
that he's going to be co-ceo with ted
sarandos who's
a wonderful guy and they really are sort
of co have run the company together for
years and years um he is
uh tough he's uh very very honest
uh he's a visionary he has no rear view
mirror
no nostalgia it's always forward forward
forward forward for reed
and he takes being a leader very very
seriously
so i mean that's the it's his
empathy and compassion on top of that
big brain and hard driving
work ethic that i think is the right
combo
um but you know i've known reid for
25 years now and um every day he wakes
up and wants to be a better leader than
it was
the day before and that's the difference
that that's that's that's amazing and
and of course now you just get to yell
at ceos for a living
no i'm you know it's funny when people
meet me
after they read my book they say oh
you're so
nice
we didn't expect you to be warm
because they think i just go around
firing people all the time
no i mean i i love ceos
early in their career you know you were
asking me earlier about
um so can you change and
what processes have to be there and i
just did a ceo
interviewed me last week for a venture
firm right so these are all
and they're like they all want to ask
about the rules
you know they got 40 people
how much structure would we need to have
and i think maybe
one thing we can talk about too is um
[Music]
on culture
you don't write it down and keep it
right that's what i hear from young
people you know how we're the
young companies i don't mean young
people uh young companies will say we
love our startup culture it's so much
fun how do we keep it that way
and i tell them you don't
so one of my stories that's in my book
is one of our this is early on
we were maybe a hundred people and uh
one of my engineers said you know i
don't think management understands that
everything's changing and it's not like
it used to be
we don't know each other's names and
everybody doesn't know what everybody
else is doing
management doesn't understand management
doesn't understand that the culture's
changing and i said you know rob
i'm a vice president and i report to
the ceo and you and i have had this
conversation seven times
so the first part of your sentence
management doesn't know
is completely untrue because
i'm management and i know okay the
second part is
um yeah it's it's true things are
changing all the time do you know what
we want to be when we grow up
and he said well i know we want to be
successful i said
a global corporation
that's that's that's what we want to be
it's not going to be like it is now you
know why things are changing
because we're successful and
oh by the way you're kind of a startup
guy you're kind of a 50 person company
guy and you can keep doing that for the
rest of your life
really you won't ever be working in a
successful global corporation
because they don't exist at 50 people
why do you think why do you think people
cling to
you know nostalgia i think people cling
to it because it's fun
right i mean that's the whole point of
what we did you know we were
we had had a layoff um then the company
got really successful and we're doing
twice as much work with a third as many
people
and it was fun i mean we were just
killing it
it was like oh my god what's happening
here what's deep underneath here
and that's when we wrote the chapter on
high performance
which was now we had the right people in
the right jobs it was rocking
you know and people knew exactly what to
do because it was life or death
and so people were just freedom and
respect all this stuff was happening
and i remember about a year into that we
were about to go public
and i looked at my finance team and i
had like three peoplehood worked in a
public company
and i thought oh no
they're the wrong team and they were
wonderful people
but you know it's you know that i mean
it's completely different story all of a
sudden you're a public company and gap
accounting and all that kind of
we were doing stuff with you know
spreadsheets figuring out how to pay the
studios
so we had to kind of up level the team
and so the culture is so
the point i want to make about culture
is
you have to look forward and come back
to the team that you have
and be really clear about where you're
going on a really constant basis
and you have to pay attention to it
right
you really literally have to sit down
and spend time and say
who are we how are we acting with each
other is it the way we want to be
do we want to change behavior how are we
going to do that at the top first
so that other people can see it and so
it's just this evolving evolving
netflix has rewritten the doesn't have
the culture deck anymore it's a new
document
and the new document includes a lot of
stuff about
uh cultural difference and global
diversity because
and netflix is mostly a content company
now right so it's
it's a completely different company than
when i left eight years ago
and that's wonderful i mean right and
it's a completely different team
by and large so that's the part where if
you're a leader
if you're a ceo it's your job
to steer the culture forever
and don't have a rear view mirror patty
